After I tried to upload it now the file can't be opened at all. Before I tried to use that feature the file opened fine. Plz fix!!!!,October 31 2016,2

The only issue I have are two things. When downloading a large file 2g or up it will hiccup and go to pause even though there is a large seed. Second  when downloading large torrents sometimes  but now more frequent  it has been erasing my download list showing nothing downloading  I know it's there because if my file app. Again I would still recommend this app. 10/10,October 30 2016,5

I downloaded all the songs I want  but later  it would download the entire album depending on which song I downloaded so I had hundreds of songs in my playlist (which I cannot listen to for some reason). Plus  it doesn't bring up some artists such as the Killers. It's a fantastic app  but in the long run its kinda a pain with how crappy my phone is with all the music downloading  it lags it completely. Decent app.,November 29 2016,3

When you finally find what your looking for after a tedious search its usually corrupt or a bad download. Nothing new or really old is available for download and if they are its usually a knock off. Oldies and Modern day artist are a rare commodity to come by in your search unless you find a download with ridiculous storage requirements. The only thing good about this is being able to download porn  even then its lacking.,December 09 2016,1

com.frostwire.android,I just can't figure it out! Being blind It is difficult enough to find apps in the Play Store that I can use. Listening to music is one of the few things that I can do and enjoy. It is SO frustrating to find an app that I can use it only to find that the devs hasn't bothered to label the buttons in the app. The screen reader on my phone will only tell me that the button is unlabeled  and will tell me nothing of what it does. C'mon man! Don't be too lazy to add an extra small string of code per button,December 12 2016,3

com.frostwire.android,Very temperamental If you minimize the app before the files transfer to your phone  you lose it all. If it's seeding  you have to baby it until it's finished or you lose it all. Other than the obvious frustration from that  it's actually pretty good. I've found some really good stuff on there. I gave it 3 stars for that reason. If you fixed the problems with it  it would definitely be a 5 star app.,December 17 2016,3

When my kids and I are being picky and don't want to listen to the radio or Pandora or our own music library  or there's a new song we HAVE to hear again and again  we can just pop on Frostwire and download to listen right then and also later  which is important because we can't just hop on YouTube every waking minute  nor do I want to.,January 11 2017,5

I also noticed while in my music folder  it downloads the whole CD to a lot of songs  but only allows you to listen to the original song you chose to download. I wasn't able to see this while in FrostWire  only when I went to All Music in my actual Music Player. I was a big FrostWire user in the past as a teenager  but for movies  so I was excited to see this in the app store for music  however  it just is not the same. I'll keep looking.,January 20 2017,2

com.frostwire.android,Best app ever for downloading,January 26 2017,5
com.frostwire.android,Great when it works  but unfortunately that isn't very often. Most music I like isn't available on the app  and even if I did find an album  most times it wouldn't download properly anyway. Now  that would be okay with me  but instead of just deleting the broken files from my phone  it instead keeps them and makes them impossible to delete from my storage. I've got so many broken songs and files cluttering up my phone now  and I have no way to delete them because they're 'stuck' on my phone. Very  very infuriating  and it really makes my music selection untidy. Will not be using your app again.,January 26 2017,1

com.frostwire.android,Really the best app ever for free music  but about 75% of the music I search isn't there. So maybe a big song update? Also after downloading some songs you either find out they couldn't download or are not the right songs. A resolve to that would be being able to preview the song before downloading it. I would also give 5 stars if you fix it! Will forever use this app though as long as it keeps up.,January 23 2017,4

com.frostwire.android,Always been my to go to music downloader Only issue I have had with FrostWire is the fact that it can be misleading when purchasing the ad free version $5.95 for a year no in reality it's $5.95 for a year with the price of payment of that per month maybe fine print that a little better cause when I was receiving ads after first month payment I'm wondering wtf Other than that another thing is you guys could used a volume booster of sorts on your equalizer which doesn't really work well Also maybe when ppl download music you guys can find the cover art for the album's or tracks Food for thought I'm a Loyal Fan been team FrostWire for Years  just a couple of things to still iron out,February 05 2017,3

com.frostwire.android,I love it...just a little problem...for seeding...too slow...plsss...fix that...,February 07 2017,5
com.frostwire.android,Initially it worked well. Could find most of what I looked for  although i had to weed through a zillion covers first. Unfortunately  I have to go through a thousand hoops to close the app. And now  there is nothing but covers. And  if I delete the app  I lose the music. So  yeah  it's good at first  but idk if it's really worth the hassle and memory it requires Response - whenever I click exit I MUST watch the ads that pop up or the app will not close. And  that is ONLY after I've done this at least 3X. Sometimes as many as 7X. So  when I am trying to conserve battery it is EXTREMELY irritating. I don't use an SD card. I have lots of storage on my phone  no need for it. Other apps download the music to my phone. This one doesn't even let me move the music over to my mp3 player. It's weird. And annoying. I'll look for an update  but idk if I want to open the app again. It takes sooooooooo long to shut it down,February 07 2017,3
com.frostwire.android,Awesome,February 07 2017,5

Used to be my fav go-2 music downloader  until they started these hijack advertisements that you can't close  try to exit out of the frostwire and you have to watch 3 or 4 stupid game commercials that you cant close. if you home-screen exit  frostwire will run in background draining your battery  try to exit again  you have to start watching their long adds again. the force-adds have gone to far. time to uninstall.,February 09 2017,2

com.frostwire.android,Awesome,February 08 2017,5
com.frostwire.android,Great when it works  but unfortunately that isn't very often. Most music I like isn't available on the app  and even if I did find an album  most times it wouldn't download properly anyway. Now  that would be okay with me  but instead of just deleting the broken files from my phone  it instead keeps them and makes them impossible to delete from my storage. I've got so many broken songs and files cluttering up my phone now  and I have no way to delete them because they're 'stuck' on my phone. Very  very infuriating  and it really makes my music selection untidy. Will not be using your app again.,February 08 2017,1

Thank you to the developers for bringing this!!! It seems like everyone was starting to lose hope after Limewire was found out to be terrible after hearing about their lawsuits for whatever reasons.

com.frostwire.android,This is downloader is awesome! Download it! You won't regret it!,March 17 2017,5
com.frostwire.android,It works  you can download music. Very hit or miss though and it seems to me that whenever I look for current or widely popular content  is when it misses most. Then when it recommends downloading the plus version of the app  it's about getting paid. I can understand that  the people that created and maintain this app would like to get paid for their efforts. Guess it now depends on how much it will cost....,March 17 2017,4

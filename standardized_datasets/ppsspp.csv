Why?.... I can't open ppsspp and play dragon Ball z it keeps saying ppsspp has stopped,November 14 2016,1
Became an adict to Project Diva. It does what it says. Needs some optimization on a few games  but once you tweak a few settings here and there almost every game should run fine. One thing that I would love would be to be able move the memorycard to the sd and read all the dlc and stuff from there instead of wasting some valuable space on the little internal memory I have on my phone.,November 14 2016,5

It's awesome but... It's great. It makes us feel we are playing on a PSP but the thing is  when I have a faster phone compared to a slower phone. That is a new phone versus old phone  the game in the old phone is too slow and the game in the new phone is too fast. Please fix that. But that won't stop me from rating this app 5 star. Whatever you did is a great job. Thanks a lot.,November 13 2016,5

Just one problem It's awesome. But what it lacks is the ability to press more than 2 buttons at one time. I was playing AC Bloodlines and found that I can't sprint cuz it required holding R and X while moving the analog stick. The commands won't budge and I was really annoyed. Can you please fix this?,November 06 2016,4

Loved it until I got an S7 Up until yesterday I used this app every single day for over a year. That was on my LG G4. Upgraded to an S7 yesterday  slid my 64gb in  powered up psp and if you can imagine  I was pissed. Got the s7 (snapdragon 820) specifically for the bad ass screen  and more power for emulators and games  namely this one. Bro this is the killer app... please fix to support s7. I don't hate the app  I love it. I play it at work in the office.. I play it at home smoking a joint. Please FIX!!!!!!,November 06 2016,1

Work as far as your knowledge takes you. All you noobs who whines about you cannot play this game  or that game  know your stuff beforehand or check the goddamn ppsspp FAQ. disable fast memory if it often crashes in game. use auto frameskip and 1X rendering for slow games. FYI  some game are incompatible at all. MediaTek mt6580 with mali mp400 mp2 could work it but on 2x psp render  some scenes are still choppy.,November 04 2016,4

To those who giving lower than 3stars Saying that slow because of your phone is just crappy and cheap. Get your ass a better job  and get a better phone with this. Or just piss off and get your lazy ass back to your beloved angry bird world.,October 28 2016,5

Works when tweaked properly: I had to keep tweaking settings for it to work well. Galaxy S7 Edge is my example. There are hella choices for rendering options and more. The trick is to configure screen resolution  frameskips  and emulated processor overclocking. Initially the default 100% psp's GHZ is choppy (audio too)  I use 200% psp's performance  achieving full intended speed on Grand Turismo. Battery drain is impressively low unless your display is bright and/or high resolution. I expect good newish phones to use this app well.,October 28 2016,5

Great but it looks like these updates made it slower. The game will now lag a little bit/decreases fps after a loading screen or checkpoint. Fast speed will go back again if and only if I open my notification panel or adjust the volume (in response with my phone's user interface  or anything in my UI must show up in my screen  the emulation will go back to its normal speed again). I hope you notice this one too  I'll be waiting for the upcoming update.,October 19 2016,4

Great This is a really good emulator and is very promising as it can run a few games at full speed in the emulators early stages.

However  after the update  I wasn't able to go 'All-Out-Attack' mode  or sometimes it crashes while I'm playing or when I'm saving the state. I would appreciate it if You would explain is it because of the update  or something else. If it is  indeed  the update's fault  please work on it fast to fix the bug.,October 14 2016,5

Needs a little work Most games like God of War chains of Olympus are laggy and glitchy. I've tried numerous times to adjust the settings but most games are unplayable. The games like Final Fantasy Crisis Core works well. But most games you'd like to play won't. I've never found a decent psp emulator. I've tried most :( not worth downloading,October 14 2016,1

Great idea but very laggy I really wanted this to work. I love my old psp. But this has massive lag on anything I chuck at it eg gta vice city  car games the only game that doesn't is luxor which Is a 2d game  it doesn't improve on my pc either. I daresay it will improve just as uae did a few years ago. So 3 stars to encourage development. Once the lag issues are fixed I will buy.,November 30 2016,3

"Seems as if the recent update made the emu laggy... and that warning power save mode message appearing is so weird I'm NOT in that mode! Why does it say """"""""""""""""warning battery mode is ON""""""""""""""""? My device isn't on that mode. On top of that  the games I have now lag and flicker annoyingly even with the same settings I've always had since the last version. Not a reliable alternative to just bringing my real psp to play games  time to switch back to playing in the real one instead on my tablet too with this app. Please fix it to work good as it always did back in your previous version  I'd be happy to rate this 5 stars again once the warning message and lagging stops... :/""""",November 25 2016,1

The emulator itself is perfect  which is why it's so disappointing that the developer would sabotage it's own emulator. They decided it was a good idea to map the back button to BOTH the savestate menu as well as a savestate button. This means that when you go back to load a previous savestate  it is overwritten by the same button that lets you visit that menu. Truly a shame  hopefully a competent dev will pick up these broken pieces and make something half-decent.,November 22 2016,1

It's hit or miss I've had this app for several years now and although it's great when it works  sometimes it does lag a lot with the audio enabled. I've also had many issues with save states bugging and crashing the entire app. That kind of ruined a few games for me because all of my save slots ended up crashing and wiping out any progress I've put into the games. Hopefully this issue will be fixed in the future.,November 20 2016,3

Only runs smoothly with few games I don't know if the problem is with my device or the emulator itself. Persona 3 portable and FF crisis core works without lagging but games with 2D grapics lags like hell. I played my old Final Fantasy I with no problem except laggings when in map and the music is horrible. Now playing Final Fantasy II and lags everytime  even the music sounds horrible. It used to be great until the emu only runs smoothly on games that are MORE than 100 mb. Like why? Will give the other stars once it is fixed.,December 14 2016,3

VR HEADSETS FOR 3D GAMING This is a great PSP app. Finally an emulator that you can use a mobile phone Virtual Reality Headset with. In the Graphics settings scroll down & click on where it says Cardboard as in Google Cardboard but you can use any VR headset.

No matter what I change in the audio settings I cant get games to sound smooth. Always choppy sound. Turn off audio & games run better.,January 04 2017,5

Great but... This is one of my go to emu on android. The only problem w/ this is that some games ( AC3/SL/LR  BRS:TG  and VP:L) runs perfectly at start-up but ultimately fails by either freezing during gameplay  decreased FPS/spd until it stops  and/or lack of visual during combat/battle phase(but can still move  select  & atk). Also  maybe its on my end but whenever I try to create a game specific setting  it force close the app. But over all its one of the best psp emu out there (phone probably hates this app tho),January 06 2017,3
I love it Very well,January 06 2017,5

v1.2.2-774-gf4999bc is the best version of PPSSPP for the LG G Stylo. All latter versions have speed issues and graphical glitches. Especially the latest nightly  as of Jan. 10  2017. Guess it doesn't like Adreno graphics drivers that much. I really wish the developer would make this emulator easier to deal with different hardware configurations.,January 10 2017,3

"Have been waiting for it to support Galaxy S7. They say a fix is coming """"""""""""""""real soon"""""""""""""""". But have been waiting almost two years and still nothing...starting to think the developers have abandoned this software. Games will crash upon starting or if through a miracle you can start playing after 20 tries  it will crash in the middle of your playthrough...it gets boring waiting for a fix. S7 users forget it.

After The Last Update (1.0.1) PPSSPP became AMAZING... I Give It MORE thank 5 Stars. The Only thing PPSSPP users should do is finding appropriate settings that's all... But the Only bac thing is that you can't play online with coldbird using mobile data :( Fix it please!!,January 22 2017,5

Good App,January 21 2017,4
This is the great app,January 21 2017,5
There are some several issues  which made me rate this a 4/5 instead of a 5/5. Firstly  there is an issue with the audio in some games  which bugs me a lot! A bit laggy and distorted. Secondly  the app crashes quite a considerable amount.I was about to win too üò£. Thirdly  the lag is quite big on some games  making it unpleasant to play. However  even with all these issues I still find this app incredible and very handy. I look forward to seeing more updates done in the future. üòÉ,January 21 2017,4

I have installed the PC version  and now the mobile. If you're reading this because you're wondering what PSP emulator is the best  PPSSPP is definitely  if not one of the best PSP emulator out there. I have never experienced any lag. Even if I do  that's not PPSSPP's fault. Don't like the controls? That's the reason settings are there. Have a bluetooth joystick for mobile? Connect to PPSSPP right away! Now I urge you to get PPSSPP Gold right away if you can. There is no difference  except the beautiful gold logo  and that satisfaction to be able to help Henrik. I myself couldn't  as I am a high-schooler with no wage. All in all  PPSSPP is one of the best  if not the best PSP emulator available. The fact that Henrik released it for free is one of the many things you should thank him.,February 10 2017,5

Easily the best 100 bucks you will never spend. Even an old beat to heck psp can set you back a pretty penny and that is without the games  even then there is the fact that one is the size of a small brick. So why bother with all that when you can get it for free with better visuals and audio? Simple you would need a monumental hole in your head. This has taken almost everything that I have tossed its way and done very well. All at full fps and with some really good graphics. However it is not perfect. Things to know  if you are a fan of Armored Core like me  Last Raven doesn't really work. If that were working I would drop a dozen stars. Also some other games do not always work smoothly  but hey  it's free right. You will need a powerful phone however. Emulators by nature are power  memory and hard-drive hogs. This is no exeption. Minimum is a Samsung Galaxy S 5 with at least 32 gigs of space. Best bet  Moto Droidz or anything really powerful. IPhones and windows phones are not recommended due to their locking of software. Jailbreaking in can void your warenty. That said  exellent work. And give gold a shot  these guys can use all of the support they can get.,February 15 2017,4
AWSOME!!!!!!!!,February 15 2017,5

Good,February 19 2017,4
(Performance of games depend on game and phone power) runs everything and has a great amount of options (resolution  emulation tweaks  shaders  ...). Battery consumption is alright (4-6 hours of Persona 3 Portable). Tested games: P3P  Armored Core 3 and Last Raven  Patapon 2 and 3  God of War (all working) WARNING: Always save through the game. Do not rely solely on save states as those tend to corrupt or become incompatible with newer PPSSPP versions.,February 19 2017,5
thats good,February 19 2017,5

I liked it over all but i wish you had a ps2 emulator built for andriod since the games for this are iso and ps2 emulators for pc use iso it cant be to hard to make a port for android and it would open up an even wider customer base and you could charge more than 6 bucks for a good ps2mobile emulator because while the game selection for the emulators isnt your problem it blows hard for psp port its so much better for ps2 port there just isnt a port for your mobile device you built the best psp port for andriod plz build the best ps2 port,February 18 2017,4

All you noobs who whines about you cannot play this game  or that game  know your stuff beforehand or check the goddamn ppsspp FAQ. disable fast memory if it often crashes in game. use auto frameskip and 1X rendering for slow games.

UltraPSP is another app that most think is a PPSSPP clone. However  this one seems to be pretty good. The compatibility is rough like most PSP emulators. However  many reviewers claim to be able to run games on this one that even PPSSPP has trouble with. We're not sure we believe those claims. However  with as murky as the PSP emulation market is  it definitely makes the app worth a shot if you can't get it to work on your emulator of choice. Otherwise  the app boasts some customization as well as network gaming support. It's not great  but not it's horrible either. At least it's free to download.,March 14 2017,5

A great interface  compatible with controllers  no ads  but sub-par emulation. Seriously. It runs a majority of my roms so bloody slow that it just becomes a pain just to play.

Does not support analog remapping. Hoped to switch face buttons to stick for camera control but all directs give the same mapping command. Pretty disappointing. Pretty big oversight. Honestly the face buttons should be mapped to the face buttons and the right analog by default for all games. No one has single analog controllers and psp camera controls can be remapped to analog sticks for a better default user experience.,April 05 2017,3

I have problems with playing DJ Max (its just like Guitar Hero). I need to tap two buttons at the same time but the program only lets me tap one (and the other would come  a second later). Although I have no problems with the PC ver. so the problem must only be unique to this ver. Other than that  I really like it. Runs games smoothly with minimal lag for moderately 'heavy' games. However  the same cannot be said with 'heavy' games (such as Juiced 2). Thumbs up!,April 09 2017,4

I don't know if the problem is with my device or the emulator itself. Persona 3 portable and FF crisis core works without lagging but games with 2D grapics lags like hell. I played my old Final Fantasy I with no problem except laggings when in map and the music is horrible. Now playing Final Fantasy II and lags everytime  even the music sounds horrible. It used to be great until the emu only runs smoothly on games that are MORE than 100 mb. Like why? Will give the other stars once it is fixed.,April 08 2017,3

"An entertaining and slightly responsive application that gets lagged every now and then. Whenever I play Angry Birds  it becomes almost impossible to avoid noticing certain levels  mainly those that take a great deal of RAM to run  slow down. And since you are aware of the problems GTA encounters--a game which consumes a slightly large part of the phone's GPU--are you actually able to take action to remove that phrase """"slow on mobile""""? I am using a Samsung Galaxy S III running Android Ver. 4.1.2 with a storage capacity of 16 GB.",April 07 2017,4

This emulator has potential to be the best of all emulators...but in my galaxy j7 2016 it lags pretty much...the sound is always muffled...but  after some changing I managed to play call of duty ... but now when I downloaded and tried to play God of war: chains of Olympus  it tells me to to active buffer rendering always...in non buffering mood the game is playing very good but the screen often goes black...in buffered rendering mood  it lags so much that it is nearly unplayable...even I have the frameskip rate at 8...can you guys fix this issue?? I mean  can you guys build the app as like it can play every supported game in non-buffered mode?? Pleeeeeeeease...........,April 14 2017,5

"cool  but many games have slowdowns  maybe you could include an """"ultimate low preset"""" that sets everything to best/minimal options  a few settings are kinda confusing too without an obvious explanation  but since I don't play psp games anymore I don't remember exactly... oh  it can run everything  but I want racing games to be playable too (well  I tried to play tron and there are some bike sections  non-racing games are manageable with that little lag I have  I did lower the settings)",April 17 2017,5

The best PSP emulator on the planet. I can play many PSP games on my ancient galaxy S3. It lags on stock Android 4.3 but on custom ROM it works like a charm specially the ROM I'm using right now RR 5.8.3. I'm blown away by its performance but audio is terrible I always disable it & another thing is you have configure settings for almost every games to get best out of it there no universal settings for all games atleast on my S3. I am glad that I have this on my phone you guys are doing a great job.,May 01 2017,5

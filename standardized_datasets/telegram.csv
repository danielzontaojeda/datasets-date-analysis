Is a cloud storage! For me it means a reliable  cross platform cloud storage. I would like to have more control and more security in accessing my cloud storage.

Good encryption  serious bugs Telegram is one of he most secure messengers for non-group chats  as messages can be deleted within seconds. The group chats  however  are not at all encrypted. Even WhatsApp is saver. Furthermore  secret chats tend to be closed automatically without apparent reason. You then have to start a new secret chat with he same person. This is absolutely annoying. I do not recommend Telegram as long as these two problems aren't fixed.,November 13 2016,3

Pinning conversation Telegram is great and surely It is the best messaging app but there's one thing  Pinning or favoriting conversations! These days I have dozen of chats  groups and channels and some of them are my favorites and I should check them day to day  the problem is I can't find them easily in the conversation list. A pinning feature would be nice  we can favorite a conversation in our app and it keeps them on top of conversation list so we can easily find them later!!,November 12 2016,5

Hate it After my last post about ADGUARD it now works. But it's just not worth it. Hate the stickers and bots (what are they) but the biggest thing is the word Trending . WHO CARES WHAT OTHER PEOPLE OR YOU THINK OR ARE USING. And what's with all these messaging apps and GIFS that's so old school. Yes you can send files of any size but that still counts towards you data plan. So again useless.,November 11 2016,1

Stops at the Name My organization is requesting that I use this app. It will not let me get pass my name. After I put in my phone # and click the next button the code comes up and immediately goes to my name. I type in my first name and then last name. When I click the next button it goes back to my first name  I click next again it goes back to my last  click next again it goes back to my first. I hope you get it. Can this be fixed? I would really like to use this app.,December 04 2016,1

Notifications are weird I can't set it to where I only get an icon on the notification bar when I get message. Either I get a a large unnecessary box at the top of my screen or I don't get any notification at all. The LED light has only ever turned on once for me and never again. I just want an icon on the bar when I get a message and that's it. I also don't seem to get a notification half the time to begin with. I've gone through all of the notification troubleshooting steps as well. This should not be an issue.,November 30 2016,2
All thing are in place that they should to be. Only one thing I don't like : when I forward a message  I don't like the name of person or the name of the group or channel stick in the beginning of the messages. I don't like it write : Forwarded message from 'Someone'. I hope Telegram Team put an option for forwarding messages. Thanks a lot,November 30 2016,4

Just two suggestions: Messenger-esque chat heads (I'm using Flychat at the moment  but it doesn't work great with Telegram) would be great  and support for the new image keyboard API in 7.1.1 would be fantastic.

Second  if there was a way to change the color of the blue bar at the top of every screen thatd b neat. Thanks and I hope to see telegram the first messaging app to use video profile pictures :D,November 29 2016,5

Telegram does exactly what a messaging app should do; it's simple and easy to use. The app is very straightforward and just as impressively-it works. Everything on it works. But being simple and easy doesn't mean that it is unable to handle everything that is needed on a messenger service. I was especially impressed with the options for receiving on or off wifi. A very good product. ExHqd7w8,December 06 2016,4

Needs confirm send for stickers and gifs Love this app. Butt don't like explaining why I set my 12 year old nephew a not so appropriate Gif. Just because this app licks to automatically sends gifs/stickers without confirming. And it commonly does when thumbing throw them when looking for what your going to send. Com on its not hard to realize this fundamental flaw four screens to accidentally read tap when scrolling. And this leads to accidental. And it happens a lot to every one i know that use this app.,December 06 2016,4

Best App for Computer & Phone This is hands down the best app if you want to have your chats accessible on both your phone and your computer. Garbage Facebook messenger/chat has no desktop app  and with the mobile app you are basically giving your life away pictures and all to FB (read the UA).

Brilliant app  just one feature is missing I am glad to use Telegram  but one neat feature could be borrowed from WhatsApp  - it is possible there to send any chat to any email address.

Shoutout to all the telegram haters I can't believe people could be so sensitive to a sticker pack that telegram made. If you guys are so deeply religious  this would not even bother you in the first place. It's a joke to see bad reviews base on this  there is nothing wrong with the sticker packs. It might be unusual and out of the ordinary  but it's totally fine and it does not insult the religion in any way.,December 08 2016,5

La migliore app di messaggistica in circolazione. Niente da aggiungere. Sviluppato perfettamente  aggiornato costantemente  continuamente vengono aggiunte nuove funzioni che facilitano e migliorano l'esperienza d'uso finale. Rispetto alla concorrenza ha di meno soltanto la funzione chiamate e videochiamate e la minore diffusione tra le persone.. E quest'ultima spero ancora per poco.

Constantly up to date and always ahead of every other IM  sometimes also ahead with features not present even in some other applications like (video players  image editing  cloud storage and media management). I really like it. I admire their product life cycle and their releases which are very often and fast  Telegram must have good scrum masters  developers and management for sure :D I would like to see more attention involved in the Cloud Storage management  because it is very easy in the current version to delete accidentally a chat and therefore lose all your cloud storage with that chat. Maybe we can have a lock with pin/password/email confermation to delete a chat which we mark as 'important' and on the other hand to delete 'unimportant' chat could be without asking for password/pin/email confermation. I would also like to see a better organization of chats  groups  channels  so for example  when you have 4-5 private group where you are collecting info and stuff about 4-5 cities (1 city for each group)  then you want to have those groups grouped together in a 'master group' called for examples 'Cities for holiday'... and some other improvements are needed :) Good job!!!!!!!!,December 09 2016,5

Camera and video sending time! I don't know why it takes TWENTY MINUTES to send a two minute video! Especially when it only takes a FEW SECONDS on APPLE devices! Fix this! Also  the in app camera function should be one function. You shouldn't have to click three different buttons in three different places to get what you want. Again  Apple devices do not have separate buttons. Lastly  videos should appear in the camera roll. Why they don't I have no idea!

Different but great I really like it  it's fast  it's better than the messenger on my phone. It has the normal things as well such as emojis. It's user friendly as well and you can do a secret message kind of like an encrypted email and if necessary you can text a message to yourself for future reference kind of like built in notepad. If you don't have any contacts listed just go to invite and send them a link then tell them to download . Setup was a breeze faster than most. bn4Ro25V,December 15 2016,5

Unlike Facebook that requires to go trough an arduous approval and testing process  developers can test their bot ideas on real users - as long as they meet minimum requirements. As a result  telegram has more bots than any of the messengers mentioned in the article. Some bots are quite handy while others are just outright entertaining. There is even one sending you Chuck Norris jokes or Game of Thrones news once in a while =D,December 15 2016,5

Omg! Very Superb Messaging app This app has everything built in. From adding all your contacts to customizing your chat background displays. Also has a secret chat option for personal convo. You have the ability to send large files which is a plus. Also you'll never be left with not knowing how to use features  the menu tab has a FAQ which is very knowledgeable. qZIoEc2C,December 15 2016,5

Good Messaging App A good app  that has a very good interface and simple to use. The app itself is ad-free which is wonderful and convenient. I definitely like the app and would continue to use it  Futhermore  it also automatically imports your contacts as well which is also a great thing.,December 15 2016,5
Nice app I like it,December 15 2016,5
Great app App is pretty self explanatory and easy to navigate. You can invite all your contacts to join which is a plus. Also their is a secret chat tab which you can lock and won't be accessed by anyone else but you. Only down fall is that none of my contacts have the app and I had to invite them. Which some accepted but others didn't. wBJCwJUl,December 15 2016,5

Message Count & Emojis This messaging app is flawless. Smooth fast and reliable. If there was a message count that let you know how many messages you sent back and forth with someone that would be spectacular. The emojis look terrible now  the update made them 3Dish and it ruined them. Please go back to the original! Also  I'd like to be able to watch videos while in the chat like the iPhone.

A terrible insult to lord buddha That sticker pack containing pictures of lord Buddha is the most terrible insult I have ever seen against Buddhism. Buddhists were calm and respected the right of other people to have their own religion s. But the religious extremists are now abusing that calmness. I know  the truth is a challenge against the dazzling of the myth. That's why those aggressive extremists are afraid of Buddhism. This is not a request!! This is an order!!!!! YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THAT STICKERS.,December 14 2016,1

Thanks for stopping disturbing updates + new review down below It is regular to see an app being updated every now and then  but a while ago telegram was receiving updates every few hours and nothing was being changed. Now it is solved. Thank you developers. New Review: Programs is running very smooth  unbelievable that how fine an app can send large files and even store them on cloud without occupying device memory. Suggestion: if you could add phone calls like Viber/whatsapp + ability to sync contacts with FB Google  other apps it would be the best app ever created.,December 17 2016,5

The best communication app so far Since Messenger recently had an update with the stories hype  my boyfriend and I decided to look for an app that will satisfy our needs for communication. Messenger turned to be a social media site rather than a communication app. Thanks to Telegram for solving our problems. I like the simple and fast interface. I also like that they use iPhone emojis  not the android ones or any default app emojis. The only thing I don't like about the app is the size of the text I'm typing. It's too big.,December 17 2016,5

Advantages of telegram It's too much better than wattsup,December 19 2016,5
Great The very best messaging app. The bots make it awesome. Only problem is that reporting someone is too easy  and contrary to what Telegram says  no one verifies reports  because restrictions get put on you as soon as you get reported. Way too many people misuse this. But the entire Telegram platform itself is awesome.,December 19 2016,5

Deleting Media: Please add an option to delete shared media permanently.,December 22 2016,3

It's actually pretty good  but.... The app is pretty awesome  but I've been having a delay in messaging. The message gets sent through just fine at my end but receiving at the other end can take anywhere between 2 minutes to two hours. There has even been instances of the delay being more than a day. My friend is almost always connected to his WiFi so I know that internet is not the issue as messages do go through other apps  just not this one. I hope that this will be something you take into consideration for a later update.,December 22 2016,3

Security Breach 1. Telegram must support apps like Google Authenticator. In countries where the telephone company is owned by the government  Telegram is not that safe anymore even with two step verification. 2. Blocking can be done only for contacts; and there's no other way to block users there  unlike the PC version which has the option of right clicking and blocking.,December 25 2016,4

Just focus on what it offers  morons! If Telegram is worth 5 stars  Whatsapp and Viber are worth 2. Max. And what's with all the Buddhists complaining about the Buddah sticker pack?

Hands down the best messaging app. This is easily the best messaging app I've ever used. I have tried quite a few over the years. It really is noticeably faster than the others. I love to voice message  and this is the best app for that. But it's also best for texting. In addition  you can get sticker packs for free that give you access to tons of stickers. My current favorites are the fallout vault boy  Kanye West  and a fat unicorn. I'd love to see sms integration in the future  but this app is perfect beyond that.,December 24 2016,5

A perfect app Telegram: Telegram groups are ideal for sharing things with friends and family or collaboration in small teams. They can have up to 200 members  by default everyone can add new members and edit the name and group photo. Supergroups can have up to 5000 members. They have a unified history  so deleted messages will disappear for everyone  and ordinary members can only delete their own messages. Here’s some extra information on how supergroups work: - The entire message history is visible to new members that,December 28 2016,5

Needs improvement I have been using Telegram app for over a year and it works quite well. But still needs improvement in terms of media/file downloads. The flaw is that it also downloads the media/file that you share via Telegram. This causes phone storage to run low and you now have multile copies of the same file. I hope Telegram team takes this matter in urgent consideration and fix this issue. Secondly  make our conversation including all shared things encrypted for peace of mind.,December 28 2016,3

It's a minus that it doesn't allow group broadcast like WhatsApp Boulevard LP: There actually should be buttons that let a group admin broadcast important messages to all the members in a group.

Dear developers  please read and respond my email. My phone: LG G Pro Lite (D686). When I open my phonebook  I realise that all of my contact list have been changed to Telegram number only  and I don't like that because when I want to use Whatsapp  I cannot search any contact list. I also cannot even make a phone call because all of my contact were just like dissapear (because they've become Telegram number only). So  what I do is that I uninstall Telegram. But then  ALL OF MY CONTACT LIST IS GONE. I literally have no contact in my phonebook  like it's new.,December 31 2016,3

In WhatsApp for example you can expand all new messages and read even previous history in chat. Hope to see this feature soon in Telegram too,December 30 2016,4

Best app,January 03 2017,5
My absolute favorite messaging app  but... Even though the app/service is excellent and fixes come quick (which is great)  this technically isn't an open source application since these latest updates aren't being hosted on GitHub anymore. Fix that ASAP  it's one of your bigger selling points compared to others. While you're at it  re-enable the damn issue tracker. If you're going to claim to be an open-source project  don't make it miserable for the open-source community help a bit.,January 03 2017,3

Why our partners would be able to easily delete the pm which they sent You should back to last version  editing was enough for if when do little mistake with our text. Deleting recent message is awkward  it's not safe,January 03 2017,1

Telegram isn't perfect  but I think it's the best instant messenger right now. WhatsApp might have slightly more style  a larger userbase and voice chat  but Telegram has a desktop app that doesn't require tethering to your phone and stickers. Being able to retract messages and have self-destructing chats is also cool.,January 03 2017,5

Okay  this app is officially ridiculous. You need to find a way to make it so people aren't limited to sending messages to mutual contacts only even though they haven't done anything. Seriously. If this happens again for no reason  I'm deleting the app.,January 03 2017,5

Better And The Best Better than Whatsapp.Wish there is video call and voice call.More stickers! Optimised battery usage.Really love the new quick reply.,January 03 2017,5
Another example of a great app that is getting worse and worse. If you want to prevent the app from activating the camera every time you open the attachments menu  you have to completely restrict the app from having access to your camera. So if you want to keep your battery from draining and your device from crashing  you cannot even have the option of using your camera at all with this app anymore (but ONLY if you have a newer Android version). Ridiculous. Find another messaging app that actually listens to and cares about its users needs.,January 03 2017,1

Only Lacking Encryption for Group Chats My only dream request is to implement encryption for group chats.

Twitter Support Team Sucks Telegram was functioning properly until it did not  which makes the Telegram staff look unprofessional when making this deception. Also  the Twitter support team is very selective when helping people. They never helped me  even though I waited for a month to no avail. Stay away from Telegram is what I suggest.,January 02 2017,2

I hate it because you can't register without mobile number,January 05 2017,1
Change Message Grouping On the last update you decided to group messages from the same person in group chats  but the avatar floats down until the last message that they sent. That's confusing and since I'm used to it being next to the first message  I'm still reading half the chat thinking the first messages in a group belong to the previous poster. Change it back or give us the option to decide how we want the avatar to display. I'll give 5 stars at that point.,January 05 2017,3

Group chats problem In the last update (Jan 2017) there's a problem reading messages in group chats. It's not obvious who exactly sends a message in a chain of messages  because the profile picture of the sender is only attached to the last message in the chain. Inconvenient.,January 05 2017,3
5x Better and Streamlined Skype Messenging The cloud storage got me sold and the sticker functionality and choice of background is amazingly artistic! You can use custom sticker packs  so I'm getting to drawing! If it had backgrounds for different people and more message sound options  I would love it even more.

Outstanding but with issues. Telegram is my favorite messaging app. Besides bots  which is something that needs to mature still. Telegram has the the best features of all messaging apps. Unfortunately  I always have issues with notifications. Half the time i don't get notified and i only realize there's a new message when i open the app. The contacts list has syncing issues also. Been like this for like a year now.,January 05 2017,4
Useless feature gifs have all but stopped updating on mobile and are regularly broken  and the new 'feature' of changing anything enshrouded in asterisks to bold text is infuriating. Will update once it's fixed  if it's fixed.,January 05 2017,2

Almost perfect. (It would be perfect if it had voice calling. But it's not an app for that  so it's ok.) Something they CAN do: add a way to move through the length of an audio message. Having to start over to hear a particular section is really annoying!,January 05 2017,5

Please fix this problem: Like desktop version  i want to scrol to anywhere in a group or in a chat  forward a message or some messages to somebody and when i come back to the original group page or chat page  I DO NOT WANT TO BE JUMPED TO THE END OF THE PAGE. This is ok with desktop version but it dose not work here. I want to stay in the place that i was at the original group page. It is a pain to always scroll up or down after each forwarding at the page I was. Update: Thanks you finally fixed this issue.,January 05 2017,5

Just the best instant messenger around. Just the best instant messenger arround. The reply to feature should be a basic in all apps of this type. The developeres are really putting the user experience in the first place and focusing on messaging.,January 05 2017,5
Its fine,January 05 2017,4
Useful but little messy Very useful to keep in touch and subscribe to channels  join group conversations. But after a while it gets really messy. My list of chats  channels and groups has got very messy I am having a hard time to find what I want. I think there should be a way to group my items on the list. Pinning doesn't help much. Channels seperate  chat groups seperate and real people from my contatcs I talk to seperately grouped into drop down style or tabbed style would be helpful. I expect it from upcoming updates.,January 05 2017,4

When I started using this app  it didn 't provide us with lots of stickers but today there are lots of lovely stickers available for us. But they are all some drawings showing only some emotions and like the stickers of the other apps  they don 't indicate any special meanings or words like 'hello  good mornig  thank you  good night  please  sorry  what? or so on '. It would be really interesting to all of us to include such words in your forthcoming stickers. Overall  thank you for your helpful and lovely app,January 04 2017,4

1*) It is very weak when you want to edit texts. 2*) scrolling between a long text is awful. 3*) when sending a pic  just some little words you can add below it. 4*) it is necessary to tell others that you are online OR you cant see online peoples ****) these are stars that i cant give to this miser app.,January 04 2017,1

Great work devs Thankyou for this awesome messaging app.,January 04 2017,5
Another example of a great app that is getting worse and worse. If you want to prevent the app from activating the camera every time you open the attachments menu  you have to completely restrict the app from having access to your camera. So if you want to keep your battery from draining and your device from crashing  you cannot even have the option of using your camera at all with this app anymore (but ONLY if you have a newer Android version). Ridiculous. Find another messaging app that actually listens to and cares about its users needs.,January 04 2017,1

3.16 breaks so many things You added simple markdown support that cannot be escaped or turned off  and it's not even in the changelog. It clashes with other uses of the asterisk and is really annoying. Also the grouped messages make it often hard to see who they belong to  without reading the name  and it's confusing when reading up a chat log from top to bottom. It also cannot be turned off and is really annoying. Please stop becoming Skype.,January 04 2017,1

Still use this every single day Even after 4 years,January 04 2017,5
Convenient but poor UI Easy to get a lot of people to use from different platforms such as from iOS to Android to windows. However  Lots of wasted space   compared to IRC  chat rooms take up almost four times as much space  requiring a lot of scrolling. Picking a chat room or a private message is difficult because they're all grouped together and the order constantly shifts since it's sorted by last sent message. Security implementation is also less-than-ideal  requiring you to trust telegram to not read your messages.,January 04 2017,2

Loved it Goood,January 04 2017,5
Great... When it works. Great app  solid security  and good customization. Only problem is messages have been getting delivered 6-8 hours late. Kind of... pointless to use if the main function doesn't work properly. Emailed support and no response for two weeks and counting. Would gladly pay for a working version...Edit: Still no response from support. Bummed out they haven't responded.,January 04 2017,3

nice app I like it,January 04 2017,5
Actually great but with MAJOR notification problem Honestly a great app but the fact that routinely I see a little notification on the telegram app  go into it and theres no unread message! And the notification indicator stays and just piles up as more messages come. Had to dlete and reinstall multiple times to get rid of it. As a messenger app thats a pretty big basic feature you need to get right.,January 04 2017,3

Ok Ok,January 04 2017,3
Calm down everyone You mentioning the problems with the update is good but scolding the developers for your inconvenience is bad . This was a real time bug which the devs could not foresee . It happens and they are even sending updates for the past 2-3 days to solve it . Frankly I don't see a problem with the edit message update it saves a lot of idiotic messages sent by mistake. And yes even I lost fingerprint option   but they are actively solving it . Just calm down and let them do it without you hurling insults. Peace out,January 04 2017,3

The new update is great because it allows you to delete the messages you sent but don't want the other person to see them.

Superb App Nice 1,January 04 2017,5
Convenient Cross-device syncing (unsecured) and desktop clients make this a perfect fit for my needs. Encrypted chats (which do of course not sync between devices) give peace of mind when I have to send sensitive information to someone. Auto destruct helps keep said info or of the hands of thieves even if I lose my device. And all of this is easy to use on all platforms. Perfect.,January 04 2017,5

Amazing app  one bug though Telegram is overall an amazing app and I prefer nothing else to work with  although with more recent updates Telegram has a tendency to 'remind' you every hour of unseen messages  which drives me crazy. I'd be amazing if this could be fixed by either getting it out entirely  or make it an option to turn off.,January 04 2017,4

The one stop shop! This is the one application I don't think should bring instant voice/video features. There are loads more apps around. Telegram should be focusing on existing strengths and resist temptations to look like other apps like Viber and whatsapp etc. The groups and channels are unique strengths of telegram. One extra addition I like to have is cloud facilities for channel operators. Thanks for the wonderful application.,January 08 2017,5
Find another messaging app. The inability to disable the camera preview when the attached menu is open is absolutely unacceptable. If you want to prevent the camera from launching  wasting battery  and crashing older devices  you'll have to disable it in the system permission menu (but only newer versions of Android support that  meaning old devices are still losing battery and crashing because of this offensively obvious bug that they refuse to repair). Find yourself a messaging app that supports  instead of ignores  its community.,January 08 2017,1
Another example of a great app that is getting worse and worse. Opening the attachments menu activates the camera automatically without your permission  wasting battery life and crashing older devices. This bug cannot be disabled in app  just like the new bug/feature where switching to a chat now forces you to scroll down one line just to read the new messages which were instantly displayed before. These new additions need to be options  on by default if you insist on showing us your big boy programming skills  but absolutely need to be toggleable.,January 08 2017,1
Update removed some features. Update removed bold text and italics. Those are really useful  and they're no longer working. Bring them back to get five stars!,January 08 2017,1

La mejor app de mensajería Rapidez  seguridad  actualizaciones  multiplataforma.... Telegram supera a whatsapp en todo menos en usuarios  espero que cambie porque deja a la competencia en pañales  siempre va un paso por delante. Mi apoyo a los desarrolladores por su trabajo,January 08 2017,5
The only messenger apps That allows you to send message to yourself! This is great  provide easy way to send file and text between Android to PC.,January 08 2017,5
After Facebook bought WhatsApp... I did a little research and turned to Telegram. God only knows how trustworthy my data is with them but I certainly trust Telegram's setup more than WhatsApp now. I can send 1.5GB files  too! What's cool is that very soon after an update I usually get another update which I'll presume is a special build from the government because updates aren't noted on the update to the update.,January 08 2017,5
No notification I'm not getting notifications,January 08 2017,2

So so! A typical Russian thingy 🤐 I prefer WhatsApp; however  I had to install Telegram coz WhatsApp & Viber r kinda blocked in Iran. :( Some functions - like those of bots' - are unique & appreciable  anyways!,January 08 2017,2
Voice message! I love the voice messaging but wish there was an option to turn on auto play for one coming in from someone else when you're in their message list so you don't have to click to play if driving or something  but other than that very good app would recommend 10/10,January 08 2017,4

It’s only getting better every day as an amazing platform and a secure chat client. I love it and use it all day  every day. Update: It’s hard to convince other users to use a secret chat by default. That’s a big problem. It seems that all chat rooms are unencrypted by default unless one user insists on using the secret chat. Other similar apps encrypt end-to-end by default & users don’t have to be worried about the privacy of their conversations should one side decide not to give a crap about it.,January 08 2017,5
The best,January 08 2017,5

Names of media files are random I would gladly give 5 stars but for one issue. The names of media files change to some random numbers after I download. So  it's hard to keep track if you download multiple videos or PDFs...Wish they fix it in near future,January 08 2017,3

Edit...New issue with group chat user name Edit.... Yes  I know how to add people to groups  but it won't let me create a group with people whom I only have user names for.... It takes for granted I have people saved to contacts Even if I'm the creator of the group... I really love this app  and would like to use for my online games  but it's almost impossible to create a group with just user names without giving out my phone number or getting theirs. Self destruct Timer also needs more minute choices (5  ten  30),January 07 2017,1

Markdown is worthless on Skype and it's worthless here too It's always jarring to see bold text out of a line of messages. I can emphasize things with asterisks  underlines or god forbid CAPS if I have to. Having Telegram does auto markdown with no way of turning it off is simply absurd. Wanna use emote that has 2 asterisks like *-*? Well tough luck.,January 06 2017,1

The switch from iPhone is hard Everything is simple on the iphone  telegram wise. Although on android  i'm expecting to tap my background in order to close my keyboard  but i keep getting a popup displaying the options for the message i didn't intent to select. i was thinking telegram could incorporate this feature in the android version of telegram and maybe press and hold a message to get the options to pop up instead of just a tap. otherwise  i am loyal to telegram! going on 3 years with this app and it keeps getting better.,January 06 2017,3

Woohoo! Finally got the bulk of my friends to switch from Messenger  and I'm glad I did. I love the ability to make sticker packs  and masks  and the bots are fantastic. Just two suggestions: Messenger-esque chat heads (I'm using Flychat at the moment  but something built-in would be fantastic)  and support for the new image keyboard API in 7.1.1 would be fantastic  especially with Gboard rolling out now. Thanks! EDIT: woohoo  you did the keyboard thing :),January 06 2017,5

There is no direct way from the App itself to delete received media files. Wondering why? Update: The idea explained in reply is good  however I still see the need of a quick delete button with every media file  especially for someone like me  who uses google cloud for media storage and does not want everything to be uploaded when google sync up process runs. Updated to 5 stars  Thanks!,January 10 2017,5

The Skype killer Ever since I found out about Telegram months ago I have been using Skype less and less. Why?  because Telegram is no nonsense  much faster  syncs much better  and just works. Plus with a much more robust group chat and bot API it's a tweaker/modder's heaven. There's no video or voice chat yet  but once they're implemented rest assured there will be no good reason to choose Skype over Telegram.,January 10 2017,5

"Loving the bot API but one thing I don't understand. Why replace """"""""""""""""message"""""""""""""""" with """"""""""""""""channel_post"""""""""""""""" in the getUpdates JSON result for channels? Inside the full root of for example """"""""""""""""data.result[0].message. chat.type"""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""data.result[0].channel_post. chat.type"""""""""""""""" has a """"""""""""""""type"""""""""""""""" value which can be """"""""""""""""channel"""""""""""""""" or others which defeats the purpose of switching """"""""""""""""message"""""""""""""""" to """"""""""""""""channel_type"""""""""""""""". This causes me to add extra unnecessary perimeter tests. I hope this makes sense and hope it improves app.""""",January 12 2017,4

Used to be great And then 1 update came that made the app unusable. Whenever in group chat the persons image is displayed after the end of his sentences  not before. Makes reading the chat a pain.

Convenient Cross-device syncing (unsecured) and desktop clients make this a perfect fit for my needs. Encrypted chats (which do of course not sync between devices) give peace of mind when I have to send sensitive information to someone. Auto destruct helps keep said info or of the hands of thieves even if I lose my device. And all of this is easy to use on all platforms. Perfect. And new features are added frequently.,January 11 2017,5

Better than WhatsApp You get to read old messages on a group chat when u newly join the group  it's awesome,January 11 2017,5
Suggestion. Make an option to choose who can see our profile picture. There is a lack of privacy in that. And then give single tick for messages which a user send. And double tick for delivered messages and then a read tick for the messages readed. If you do these changes in your next update I'll be completely satisfied with this application and I'll give a five star rating.. :),January 11 2017,3

Needs confirm send for stickers and gifs Love this app. Butt don't like explaining why I set my 12 year old nephew a not so appropriate Gif. Just because this app licks to automatically sends gifs/stickers without confirming. And it commonly does when thumbing throw them when looking for what your going to send. Com on its not hard to realize this fundamental flaw four screens to accidentally read tap when scrolling. And this leads to accidental sent stickers. And it happens a lot to every one i know that use this app.,January 14 2017,4

"Don't want it to rate 4 : ( FAQ reads: """"""""""""""""We don‘t have a ’delivered to device' status for messages because..""""""""""""""""   But dear Telegram  this is a much needed feature  there's a lot of earths population where there isn't an always-on connectivity to internet. 'Few' of people  at times join Telgrm  but don't use it later  So we never come to know whether or not has the message been delivered...

It works well  has Bitmoji integration  fun to use  but has some annoying deviations from Android coding standards  such as using the system sounds channel instead of the notifications sounds channel for notification sounds  which doesn't improve the user experience and in fact interferes with it. It's hard to consign such an error to oversight in such an otherwise-polished app  so what's the purpose?,January 14 2017,4

Pretty good app  but there are some missing features. Also  open source is heavily touted but the repository seems pretty dead and locked down. It would be pretty easy to add some theme options for dark mode. And group chats need to notify which members have read the message. The app also uses the iPhone emoji font  so it would be great to be able to switch emoji fonts. Sticker search with words (in addition to the emoji search) would be very nice as well.,January 13 2017,3
Soooo good,January 13 2017,5

Better than WhatsApp  more features than Signal. The easy way to explain this app is to say  it's similar to WhatsApp  but looks better  is quicker. It also works great alongside the Desktop version  which works on it's own! Signal and WhatsApp both have to connect to your phone which makes it slow and unreliable. It also has lots more features  so many small things that add up to one great experience. It's also open source! The Encryption has been debated by Signal users time and time again  but Signal doesn't have the feature set Telegram does  and Telegram has yet to be hacked so there's that. Ditch WhatsApp for Telegram  you'll never want to look back.,January 16 2017,5

The only reason to get this app is because you have some friend that insists on it and you can't convince them to use something else. This app has zero support there are many better choices. It also requires a phone number (hey phone numbers are not IDs  emails are better) and sometimes they just don't like your phone number and that's just too bad.. hey did I mention they have *no* working support yet? I know there's work-arounds (get another phone number / burner phone / whatever) but really? When there are better options to choose from.,January 19 2017,2

Cannot Believe this.. New Update But Still does not support Voice and Video Call. Disgrace. This is not acceptable. Many people are moving back to Whatsapp because it has encryption for everything and also now Supports Voice and Video Call. This is the reason I will also have to move back to Whatsapp. Please Take out and introduce Voice and Video Calls and many more people will start using Telegram again. Its a Disaster that Telegram keeps taking updates out for pathetic small features but still does not su,January 19 2017,1

think it isn’t hard for you to develop universal app for windows 10 with features and interface like that android or ios version ! But I don’t know why you don’t develop this?

Nach whatsapp Plus Tötung  Sperre und Nachtichtenlöschung gewechselt Umswitchen ist so easy - und dafür gibt es in meinen Augen gute Gründe  denn das scheint ihr drauf zu haben im Gegensatz zu fu**books whatsapp: Sicher. Privat. Kostenlos. Synchron nutzbar auf mehreren Geräten! Schnell. auch bei Edge! Klemmt euch bis jetzt dahinter & geht persönlich auf Kritik in euren Bewertungen ein - SO muss das sein  bitte macht weiter so!!

Download this now! This is the greatest messaging app I've ever come across. Seriously  the interface is seamless and actually IMPROVES with updates. You can now access on your phone or on a computer and everything's synced. The voice messaging feature is perfect for couples (and others) to maintain intimacy that text can't always give you. I can share websites  gifs  pictures  and more with just a click. The only thing I'd love to see in the future are stickers with more variety of skin tone. I use this app with my bf (I'm black and he's white) and sometimes I like to send him cute character stickers. Current stickers are still adorable  but it'd be nice to send him one that really reminds him of me! Bottom line  you will LOVE this app. I've been spoiled and can never use anything else. 💙💚💙💖,January 18 2017,5
After recent update   all of my new messages deleted. I can't see any new pm from my friends,January 18 2017,2
Cloud based → you can access your telegram and all your messages on multiple devices. Security → it's well known Telegram is way more secure than WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger (you can read more about security in their official website). Features → Reply feature  stickers  secret chats  bots & more. Do I need to add more? Switch to Telegram now. (I just noticed I sound like an advertisement lawl),January 18 2017,5

It is a good app. improvement: considering the big amount of media files being transferred with this app in our phones  and our need to listen or watch these media files later offline  I think it is vital to add a setting where by a user can choose to receive all media files on a sd card or any other storage rather Than the main internal. tnx,January 18 2017,3

Probably the best messenger around now WhatsApp stinks. There  I said it. I didn't want to admit it for a while  but it does. It's slow  lacks features and security  and really doesn't do groups well. Telegram is the opposite in all of those respects  and I'm never going back.,January 18 2017,5

This is a great messenger. The only reason that stops me from giving it 5 stars rating is FORWARDING. Messages forwarding in Telegram is AWFUL. Why would one forward group of messages separately? I cannot understand anything because of such forwarding method and I am pretty sure I am not the only one. Can someone explain me this nonsense  pleeease?,January 22 2017,4

The app itself is just great. But every now and then it shows in my contact list people I have long deleted from my contact list. Including a fella I deleted and blocked when I still used another phone and another number. I don't know where the app gets these ghost numbers  but it's creepy as f***  and I don't like the idea of my number (and name) showing up on contacts of people who has deleted my number. Let people disappear from others' lives  Telegram!,January 20 2017,4

It is an awesome texting app. It is simple. It has unique stickers which are hilarious  makes me laugh much. It doesnt have a call option but there r other apps with that so it is fine. It has some flaws: when the app is not open in background it seems i dont get notifications which can be a little hassle. I think i get them always when the app is started in background  not 100% sure. I recommend :D,January 20 2017,5

can't hide my number phone? But whatapp fast Download and upload... Please increase the number of letters following your photos and videos and gif up to 5000 characters...,January 26 2017,1
I reset my phone into factory settings  then installed WhatsApp lost chats; installed Telegram loaded my previous chats from cloud backup. And guess what  it is more secure. The only down factor is the idiots insist on using a trojan app instead of this.,January 26 2017,5
Language problem in Nougat. When passcode is wrong. The cut/copy/paste bar. Et cetera. Please fix.,January 26 2017,4
Nice clean UI  but requires a phone number. So I can't use the app because I don't use a pointlessly costly piece of old technology? Ridiculous.,January 26 2017,2
It is excellent,January 26 2017,5

Its a good and useful app esp in managing groups chat. Its done better than whatsapp honestly in that term. One think that could be added in the next update for better performance is the star/bookmark feature. It ll help a lot if we want to revisit the important posts later. Btw the date and remember scroll position are good ones. But still it could be better with the star/bookmark feature.,January 25 2017,4

Comment : the possibility of replies based on more than just ONE post could be to useful . Like 2 or 3 post you can pick and make a reply post according to those 2 3 or more,January 29 2017,3
You really can't advertise a focus on speed because it takes forever to send messages even on high speed internet. I have 100 mbs down and it can take up to 5 minutes to send. It's infuriating. Edit: I'm aware that 1 check means sent and 2 checks mean read  but it shows a little clock meaning it hasn't been sent at all. And I know my connection is fine because when telegram is not sending I can still use wifi on other applications.,January 29 2017,2
This is the most useful app I ever seen but pls don't give us update related to android versions..i recently updated to android 7 I am tired of apps which need different kinds of android versions day by day..thank u so much for your attention and updates,January 29 2017,5

Have used this app since it's creation. By far the best messaging app out there. They keep getting better & better with each update unlike most apps. 10 stars if possible! Galaxy s7 Edge,January 28 2017,5
Doesn't give any notifications.. I have to open the app to check what messages I have received. It doesn't work in background,January 28 2017,4
Best app for instant news,January 28 2017,5
Always shows alerts for messages even when they have been checked and cleared. Annoying for someone ocd about clearing red alerts.,January 28 2017,3
Great overall! Fast  responsive  can multi-select when sharing files  no spam bots of any kind  never freezes or crashes  can be used on mobile devices and desktop/laptop pc's  loads of great stickers. I have no complaints.,January 28 2017,5
Great app. Needs more sorting options. SMALL FEATURE REQUEST WRITTEN WITH CAPS: can you add option to manually input hex color for LED notification?,January 28 2017,5
Waiting for 'reply from notification' option! The app has stopped working. It says Connecting... even though the data connection of the device is ON. And never gets connected after that!,January 28 2017,5

After the last update  it doesn't notify msgs  and not showing on the notification bar.. What happened?,January 28 2017,3
Just crap it takes too much time to verify your number. The only reason behind using this app is some Fnds insist to use this and you can't convince them. Hate it.,January 28 2017,2
This is a very nice social media though I have not used it but my friends introduced me to it saying it works pretty well and z new. I believe it works so.,January 28 2017,4

Anjan,January 28 2017,1
When I downloaded Telegram for the first time (it was in 2015 I guess) I couldn't imagine an app like this could exist!! Now it's 2017 and I don't know why WhatsApp still has more users! I simply see no reasons why!!😞 Telegram is superior in every way. (Considering it has a desktop version meaning u can access it anytime anywhere. Even if your smartphone is down for sometime.) It's just awesome. Thank you.😘❤,January 28 2017,5

Awesome. It does what it does  it is safe  cloud-based and pretty much multi-purpose especially with the new update. It is useful to be able to access only Telegram even for your own mail inbox. Sending files is easy. The only thing left is for the video or voice call to be made possible. This is probably the best IM messenger replacement I have ever used.,January 31 2017,5
I wish have video call,January 31 2017,3

I hope the team exceed these restrictions. البرنامج ممتاز جدا ويحمي الخصوصية والسرية تماماً وهذا يثبت سبب تم التضييق عليه من الحكومات على عكس واتساب المراقب! نتمنى من الدعم تخطي هذه التضييقات,January 30 2017,4

"The """"""""""""""""security"""""""""""""""" on the app is only half the story. The protocol they use DOES have end-to-end encryption  however  this doesn't mean they can't still read through your metadata. Put simply: metadata is just your history. For example: You called your doctor 3 times and looked up STDs on the internet  but they don't know what was said in the calls. They know everything about you  and you can't do anything about it.""""",February 02 2017,1

UPDATE: Many people  myself included  seem to have trouble with notifications recently. Please fix this issue ASAP. It has it all: cloud based  access from multiple devices  encrypted messages and the possibility to send any kind of file. Not only that  but it's free and open source. (although not completely yet) Apart from the number of people using it  it has virtually no disadvantages to the other mainstream messaging app.,February 05 2017,5

Much better than overrated Whatsapp. Certainly  faster than Whatsapp. But the two things it lacks - Audio-Video calls,February 05 2017,5
Security lacking Chats are not E2E encrypted by default  the cryptographic implementation is homemade and broken and the app is nearly impossible to build from source without binary blobs.,February 05 2017,3

If I have to rate between WhatsApp and telegram I will rate WhatsApp only two star where as I will rate Telegram 5 stars because it is very fast and then also it consumes very less amount of data it has many features like stickers stickers GIS photos app sending file sending documents and many more people are only about name and seen but they don't see and what other apps can also do they can be more better than the other app that have name and fame Telegram I love you the best Messenger App,February 04 2017,5
That's closest to perfection that any messenger has gotten into. Despite the app disconnecting randomly and not displaying notifications most of the time  it's a very  very good experience. It's cloud based and encrypted altogether  making it the perfect app for those who likes texting. My only complaint is with the notification bug where it doesn't show unless you open the bloody app.,February 04 2017,3
So good,February 04 2017,5

The only reason I have imo + Facebook Messenger installed on my phone is the voice call feature. For video call we can use Google Duo but having HD voice call ( or even group voice call compatibility) in Telegram is crucial. Please give us Voice Call feature as soon as possible. Please Pavel Durov! We need it.,February 04 2017,5

Delete recently send messages is really bad   everyone have to stand to what will says or write... (Sorry for my spelling mistakes),February 04 2017,4
Telegram is reliable  easy to use  and feature-rich. If the devs can see their way to adding call/video chat support  and maybe SMS/MMS handling  Telegram could rival Facebook Messenger as the most useful messaging app on the Play Store.,February 04 2017,4
There is no scroll-bar in Instant view  so can't understand how long page. It's looks like manipulation to read all to end of page and waste time.,February 04 2017,1

So whatever you need to make a Telegram more secure and also VoIP call like ZRTP and no other app will gain your security and privacy  Working with WhatsApp  they want to know everything about the user now they will make a feature that track you even if you don't want to. So use Telegram or Silent apps,February 03 2017,4

You can't search member in a group  you can delete your message that has been delivered and the after you delete  the receiver can't read that message. If you want to add new contact  you must know the number. That make difficult if you want to make a group. because when you want to make a group  you must at least have one person. And if you want to make a group that will be filled by a new person whom you don't know  it will make complicated,February 07 2017,5

They(support team) did not even show me the proof of that  I am spammer. Poor guys!,February 10 2017,2

Two problems: 1. When you want to delete some contacts  you can't delete them together  but you have to delete them one by one  and each time you delete one  it goes back to the first page  so you have to go ask the way to contact page again and find the next contact you want to delete. 2. No video calling,February 08 2017,4

Why doesn't the desktop Telegram have the same updated emojis as the mobile app emojis?? And god i would be so so grateful if you could introduce video calling  voice calling  and two possibilities.. Walkie Talkie  and also voice & video messaging  for example  sending them a pre-recorded video of something that you wanted to say to them or tell them  but you and your friend are never able to do it together at the same time  say because of time zone differences  because they work different hours  days  etc. So if it had the option to send pre-recorded voice calls  video calls  so that when you or your friend are able to have that option to watch the voice & video calls that you both wanted to have  but still have the option of listening & watching each others video & voice calls when it is convenient for both of you at what ever time you want  and also have the option for them to have a expire date & that you are able to download on to your phone  if you choose to do so.,February 16 2017,4

The sheer customization potential and expansion of Telegram is nearly unlimited  with thousands of channels and bots  plus lightning fast and secure messaging.

I absolutely LOVE telegram  but there's one little problem I'm having. You guys know that thing where you have to enter your phone number? Well  there's no problem with that  but I'm going to tell you guys straight; People sometimes join fandoms  and they don't want people in real life to know. A lot of people use telegram as a their main means of communication  and I would LOVE a feature where you can hide your phone number so no one with your number can see your display name or profile pic. Anonymity is important. Sure  anyone can go and just get a fake number to register on telegram  but that's really inconvenient. We want anonymity! Please  telegram?,February 15 2017,5

Good but.. I'll give 4 stars because I'd enjoy the most if it was more customizable  like colors of speech bubbles and button. Also the customizable emojis  like changing color of the emojis hair. But... the most important thing is... you must add the emojis in groups names. I mean.. you really have to do it. It's ugly having a group name without any emojis to show.,February 19 2017,3

Finally got the bulk of my friends to switch from Messenger  and I'm glad I did. I love the ability to make sticker packs  and masks  and the bots are fantastic. Just two suggestions: Messenger-esque chat heads (I'm using Flychat at the moment  but something built-in would be fantastic)  and support for the new image keyboard API in 7.1.1 would be fantastic  especially with Gboard rolling out now. Thanks! EDIT: woohoo  you did the keyboard thing :),February 19 2017,5

Very nice app. But can u make it more user-friendly for Moto users by enabling full screen reading mode. Today the mute button at the bottom (even when screen is rotated) & name of the channel with too much width consumes a lot of space. Further for Moto G4 plus  the upper strip of battery n clock + bottom strip of virtual buttons remains as it is. Hence plz make updates to enable full screen mode. I have a lot of useful data to read on it.,February 19 2017,4

Thanks,February 19 2017,5
This is a good communicating app in that regard however it annoyingly lets the unknown groups add you to their list and this takes over whatever you are doing at that moment. So sometimes you completely lose what you typed in other apps or all you edited in photo editors when the adding group attacks in telegram. I tried all trucks and setting to avoid this but impossible so far. Probably you need to remove all your contacts one by one to find which one leaks your information. That is a psin now with telegram.,February 19 2017,2
Very good communication app,February 19 2017,5

I love the new update! Being able to change my theme and make it my own is wonderful! The app still needs work however. In-app phone calls and video calls are a feature that needs to be added  high quality videos need to have quicker sending times (like the iOS version) and the attachment bar needs to be more organised - remove the built in Telegram camera  just one button for taking photos/videos  allow videos to be shown with the images in the bar (again  like the iOS version!).,February 21 2017,4
Very good,February 21 2017,5

Can you please make block work in groups. I can still see them talking  I don't want to even see their messages. Since stuff some people say upsets me. I love this app but I wish only for this one thing. Also I don't want them using this reply thing to send notifications to harasse me with alerts.,February 21 2017,3

Telegram is getting better and better! It is the one app that I use to stay in contact with so many friends. Keep up the great work!,February 21 2017,5
Stickers in this new version is tooooo big specially in bigger screens (i have a note4). Plz make the stickers like 3.8  it made me to downgrade to that version :( editing feature is good but 2 days is too long  sometimes somesone changes their posts and it makes confusion .,February 21 2017,5
THE BEST APP IN PLAYSTORE,February 21 2017,5

Super cool,February 21 2017,5

Telegram is the app I use for people I want to talk to. Other apps are for people I don't want to talk to. I see myself when using Telegram and it's a thing none has achieved until now.,February 21 2017,5
better than whatsapp,February 21 2017,5

I'm not getting notifications,February 21 2017,2
"No option to turn off read receipts or last seen (completely  as opposed to """"seen recently""""). App still notifies you of messages while the desktop client is running. Other than these  it's better than whatsapp and I wish more people knew about it. It's better for sending files  and the image w/o compression is great.",February 21 2017,5

Best messaging app ever  everyone should just switch to telegram,February 21 2017,5
In order to compete with Whatsapp  ⑴ make archiving conversations available so that I can make my conversation page tidier. ⑵ Let us know who read our messages in groups! There's no way to do it in Telegram. ⑶ Status like Whatsapp could be added (optional). Please improve  love it.,February 21 2017,4

Hey  listen. Telegram devs. Keep doing what you're doing. Best app ever with best developers ever! 👍👍👍👍👍👍,February 20 2017,5
I still keep what's up in my phone because telegram haven't Voip. We DON'T need photo editor! Add voip instead!!!,February 20 2017,5
I bumped Telegram up to 5 stars with the new theme engine. Kinda confusing at first  but once you get the hang of it  you'll love it!,February 20 2017,5
Normally its a good app. Especially running for channel with privacy. But in channel members are not in alphabetically order. Plz fix this.,February 20 2017,3
Great app all around. .,February 20 2017,5
Useful app,February 20 2017,5
It's better than Whatsapp and ways ahead of it it helps connect with different people,February 20 2017,4
"Maybe you can add """"pin message"""" button to make easier for us to find any messages. your black theme is awesome! Telegram is the best chat application!",February 20 2017,5
Good app for conection,February 20 2017,5
Thanks for the theme options!! I'm happy about the dark theme in the latest update and no problems loading the app so far. I was hoping if it's possible to feature flat  round cornered speech bubble options with customizable color options for the bubbles and the text in the future? Not sure how that would affect how the app functions but it's something of a visual preference for me.,February 20 2017,4
Hoya.,February 20 2017,5
Love it..but can we get a way to mark important messages like the star in whatsapp?,February 20 2017,5

Nice app,February 20 2017,5
really love it,February 20 2017,5
OK,February 20 2017,5
So it doesn't support Google Voice? R.e.t.a.r.d.e.d obviously it doesn't deserve more than 1 star,February 20 2017,5
Finally a dark theme for the official Telegram app! 5 stars!,February 20 2017,5
Trying it out so far so good and does not take much space on the phone also has good emoticons,February 20 2017,5

Safe?? Not even in the slightest! All media files received are kept OPENLY in phone storage. Setting app to keep media files for a certain period of time does not work! No self destruct passcode when forced to enter passcode. No ability to hide/delete Telegram contacts from device.. For their own safety. No ability to rename contacts for personal preference. No ability to delete files from cloud storage. This app is everything but safe.,February 20 2017,1

Latest version has a bug where if you listen to a voice message while holding the phone to your cheek  the audio will come out through the main speaker and not the earpiece. This means that if you wanted to listen to a voice message privately it would be blasted to everyone else. Please fix and I will change my rating to 5 stars.,February 20 2017,4

Hello Telegram Team. I have tow requests (Attention Please): 🚩Add #Persian language; You know that a lot of telegram users are Persian language  it is very important for us. 🚩I can't send my themes to @AndroidThemesGroup; I think Because Telegram does not allow peoples from Iran to join public groups  it is sad! Thank you. تیم تلگرام، سلام! من دو درخواست دارم: نخست اینکه زبان فارسی را اضافه کنید؛ این برای ما بسیار مهم است و همان‌طور که میدانید بسیاری از کاربران تلگرام فارسی زبان هستند. دوم اینکه من نمیتوانم تم‌های خود را برای شما ارسال کنم؛ فکر میکنم به این دلیل که تلگرام دسترسی‌های لازم را برای کاربران ایرانی مسدود کرده است؛ این خوب نیست! با سپاس.,February 25 2017,2

"Telegram is amazing app. It is lightweight  good performance  easy and friendly interface  versatile theme color  able to edit messages which is really awesome  good securities and privacy feature. This messenger is mostly perfect for me. Hereby  I want to pleased Telegram team  please provide the detail of messages seen/read status (like WhatsApp  Facebook Messenger supported this feature). This features is very important to me  I believe also to some others users. I do not request it's like WhatsApp  as simple as Facebook Messenger to show by small profile icon at the right bottom side of the message and when we click on the message  we can choose""""message detail"""" and it will appear a text to show the time of all participants who had read our message.

Great app  good service (ignoring crypto which may or may not be a problem for you). I didn't think the forcible replacement of emoji glyphs with mediocre JPEGs of Apple ones would bother me that much  but dang it does... I'm pretty sure it violates some IP license too.,February 24 2017,4

The new theme option is great and I love this dark theme.

Thank you so much  Telegram team! I love the new themes! The dark theme is just what I wanted for my AMOLED screen. Thank you. P.S  I hope you guys won't bring in the snap story thing like WhatsApp has done. It gives me more reasons now to stay away from WhatsApp and stick to Telegram.,February 24 2017,5

I love the new update! Being able to change my theme and make it my own is wonderful! The app still needs work however. In-app phone calls and video calls are a feature that needs to be added  high quality videos need to have quicker sending times (like the iOS version) and the attachment bar needs to be more organised - remove the built in Telegram camera  just one button for taking photos/videos  allow videos to be shown with the images in the bar (again  like the iOS version!).,February 23 2017,4

Download progress of videos not displaying while downloading videos.,February 23 2017,5
Waiting for code  it doesn't ask to access to storage  any way code has been received. By default why groups are there in main window. And file upload very slow as compared to other clients. Add audio and video calling.,February 23 2017,2
Nulla da dire  ma ogni tanto su Moto E LTE con CyanogenMod13 si freeza e devo attendere che riparta. Spero in un bug fix nella prossima release. Edit: con tutte le ROM lo fa  anche con quelle baste su Nougat. Edit n2: In questo momento la sto usando su Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro e sembra perfetta  complimenti agli sviluppatori!,February 23 2017,5

"If you guys can't solve its connectivity problem then bring minor or '' custom themes'' are useless.

Telegram managed to become the worst texting app after being the best .. Texts don't register for a while  sometimes text comes later or when I open the app I can receive videos and photos anymore no matter how long I wait .. It takes about 14 minutes PROVEN to send a photo not even a full size one and forget about sending video! I contacted the devs all they can do is tell me to reinstall and clear cash and I did I even factory reset my phone .. Still same issues !!!,February 26 2017,1
Telegram gets hang on my one plus 2 phone,February 26 2017,3

Please don't follow the green-iconed messenger to go from best to worst in one update. Stay away from video calling  status(es) and the like. Just stick to messaging.,February 26 2017,5
Very good app with self destruct timer. Easy to use. But lousy notification. My friend text me no notification  by the time I received is when I open the app after 2 days. Hope to have video calls. Pls work on it. Thanks,February 26 2017,4

Latest version 3.17+ has noticeable lagging when scrolling chat list. Seems it connected somehow with newly implemented custom themes engine  which causes such behavior. Inside chats it's OK. Hope that will be fixed asap,February 26 2017,3

Good one ..,February 26 2017,5
Much better an app than WhatsAp! I don't know why people stick with WhatsApp  lots of useful features & ease of access Just one suggestion : Dark theme would have had a dark Gray background instead of black - that might be more pleasant to the eye! Kudos team telegram!,February 26 2017,5

Great app. If you like Facebook messenger  then then you will love this app also. All the benefits and the best one is it isn't tied to Facebook. I only wish it would be able to access my Google photos to be able to send photos from there also  but well work a try and it doesn't replace your texting app. It is a stand alone app messenging. Exactly what I was looking for. The perfect Facebook messenger app replacement. Also it works simultaneously across all devices if logged into the same account.,February 28 2017,4

In secret chat option users able to copy all the texts and photos able to share also.

Claiming is open source and not releasing the code doesn't really means this is open source. I give one more star until displaying the name of original sender gets removed from forwarded messages  that's stupid and even we can get contacted even with no username (privacy concern).,February 28 2017,3
like the theme very much,February 28 2017,5
Awesome,February 28 2017,4
Very useful,February 28 2017,5
Unlike their competitor(s)  Telegram allows users to use their accounts on multiple devices simultaneously  which increases efficiency in work  play and whatnot. Telegram also allows users to change themes  which is one of my favourite options  alongside many others such as secret chats  etc. There's many more advantages than disadvantages that I can see in Telegram. Overall  it's the best communication app in terms of simplicity and ease of usage. Hopefully  more languages will be supported in the near future (e.g. Mandarin Chinese  etc.).,February 28 2017,5

It is an awesome texting app. It is simple. It has unique stickers which are hilarious  makes me laugh much. It doesnt have a call option but there r other apps with that so it is fine. It has some flaws: when the app is not open in background it seems i dont get notifications which can be a little hassle. I think i get them always when the app is started in background  not 100% sure. I recommend :D Thanks for reply!,February 27 2017,5

Down one star In case anyone pays attention to that. I've updated twice  expecting a new look  and still nothing. Also  (and this has bugged me for awhile) if file sizes aren't limited  how come photos get sized down? It's perplexing. Other than that  great app.,February 27 2017,5

Please can you fix white led problem. I used to be able to set it so that my notification led would blink purple. I had to turn it off recently and how I've turned it back on it will only blink blue if set to default or white if set to any other colour. Also since the latest update done of my received messages are black writing with a transparent background and I can't read them. Please change it back to all white boxes! Thank you.,March 02 2017,3

How am I supposed to take backup of my chats? There are so much unnecessary features in here. But not a basic option like backup. So irritating. And the privacy is very bad. Any unknown person can just search my name and text me and view my profile picture. Worse  it adds those unknown person to my contact list of its own accord. Now if I wanna change my number its says it will send my new number to all in my contacts. What kind of privacy policy is this? Its so dumb. Im not even able to remove those unknown people from my contact list. It just keeps adding them. I even deleted them from my mail contacts list. Still it just keeps coming. So frustrated.,March 02 2017,2

Really  this has to be the best-ever messenger. Amazing support service  thousands of stickers  very good design and colours (at least for Android)  bigger groups than WhatsApp or any other  secret chats that show if someone takes a screenshot and automatically deletes messages  many useful bots  pictures and files stay in the cloud  channels and supergroups of up to 5000 members  ability to make your own sticker packs... the review would be too long to post if I listed everything. Download.,March 04 2017,5
Release the source code now  if you call it an open source... it has been months now since the last time you released the base code. 😒,March 04 2017,1
I downloaded this mainly because my game guild uses it. It's my gaming messaging app. I have not much too say  I like the way we can send voice messages. The way to send pics or vids or music  not bad. It makes things easy. Also great great great smileys and stickers.^^ Edit: With @gif and @gamee we sometimes forget that we're supposed to talk strategy  our channel turned to fun zone😂  but it's for the alliance channel only  because in the guild alliance we're a little more serious  sometimes😀,March 04 2017,5

Dear Telegram team  Thank you for your effort  your app satisfy me a lot  just some small thing I hope you can do to us. First  I personally like a small size font  but I had found out that only the text messages are apply to the font size we had set  but the font for musics  participants name  web contains  the contains of message we tabbed to reply are still remain the default font size which I really disappointed with. Please make all those font size apply to what we preferred. And secondly  please figure out somewhere to make the messages we sent be able to show who had received and read status. It is very important to me  so do some other peoples. I am willing to look forward for your respond. Thank you.,March 06 2017,4

"So the UX is miles ahead of many other options out there but it's encryption not being end to end (except for secret chats) and not using industry standards are concerns worth addressing.

MUITO MELHOR QUE O WHATSAPP,March 11 2017,5
it's the best!,March 11 2017,5
Simply amazing  blazing fast and has a nice ui. Customisable looks  lots of settings  and features you don't see on other messengers. For example  I came from kik to this  instantly I could tell this was better by far  it's better in every aspect besides not having video calling. Other than that I recommend telegram to everyone using kik or anything else.,March 11 2017,5
It's awesome  way better than WhatsApp because of the online cloud  bot support and so on. It's also much more trustworthy knowing what facebook owner zuckerberg is already known for. Things like Audio/Video Calls might not be available at the moment  but they're working on it. And believe me  they really listen to their audience and I love 'em for that 😁,March 11 2017,5

very working app,March 11 2017,5
I trust Telegram. I feel like Facebook Messenger  WhatsApp & Snapchat all have ulterior motives. Monetary motivations to monitor your messages to tailor an advertising solution to target you specifically. The ads don't bug me much. What bothers me is that if a corporation asked or if the government asked  they would hand over your chat life without a pause. I feel like Telegram would stand firm. They are self funded. Not controlled by investors. They are also encrypted.,March 11 2017,5
It's great,March 11 2017,5

How am I supposed to take backup of my chats? There are so much unnecessary features in here. But not a basic option like backup. So irritating. And the privacy is very bad. Any unknown person can just search my name and text me and view my profile picture. Worse  it adds those unknown person to my contact list of its own accord. Now if I wanna change my number its says it will send my new number to all in my contacts. What kind of privacy policy is this? Its so dumb. Im not even able to remove those unknown people from my contact list. It just keeps adding them. I even deleted them from my mail contacts list. Still it just keeps coming. So frustrated.,March 10 2017,2
It always happened to me that  it shows 'waiting for network....' And it stays like that sometimes for a few days 😥 Although my network shows 4G. Why did that happenend? Other than that  this apps was awesome 👍,March 10 2017,4

I would like to give 5 star over all.But yesterday this app was completely bad. It just didn't work for about 2 hours and none of my messages were delivered. Also this happened sometimes back and all the 20 messages delivered at once. Not sure why is the performance of thiz app going down. I want this app to shine better than other useless apps. I find this is user friendly and can have secret chat with friends. So  please fix the issue. Thanks in advance.,March 10 2017,5

It does not connect to the Internet in this phone. Please do something. I need your help. Telegram is my all time favorite. Please fix it.,March 14 2017,2
This app is amazing to me but I'm having a big issue where the notifications don't arrive on time or appear. I have to open the app to check to see if a message is left or not. No notification arrived  I've applied all the necessary adjustments in phone manager from last year August but it's still the same. My contacts have the same issue and it's delaying our conversations,March 14 2017,5

Beast at keeping everything encrypted,March 13 2017,5
Claiming is open source and not releasing the code doesn't really means this is open source. I give one more star until displaying the name of original sender gets removed from forwarded messages  that's stupid and even we can get contacted even with no username (privacy concern). Release latest code and will put back 2 stars,March 13 2017,2

Best messenger out there by far! Personalized  functionally rich  it's the best tool for everything! I hate it when people rate it badly because a feature is missing. Just focus on what it offers  morons! If Telegram is worth 5 stars  Whatsapp and Viber are worth 2. Max. And what's with all the Buddhists complaining about the Buddah sticker pack? Calm down  no one forced you to use it  and if you find it insulting  report it. I don't get why anyone would ever find that insulting though.,March 15 2017,5

"DO NOT DOWNLOAD...if you have only a tablet and no cell phone! You can only register with a phone. It does not state this on the read more section at all. Nor is it blocked for tablet devices ie """"not compatable with this device"""" banner. It really does suck that one can not register with an email address. That really needs to be addressed and added.",March 15 2017,2

Be sure to disable the camera permission if you're experiencing lag.,March 15 2017,5
Download this now! This is the greatest messaging app I've ever come across. Seriously  the interface is seamless and actually IMPROVES with updates. You can now access on your phone or on a computer and everything's synced. The voice messaging feature is perfect for couples (and others) to maintain intimacy that text can't always give you. I can share websites  gifs  & pics with just a click. The only thing I'd love to see in the future are stickers with more variety of skin tones. (Also  sometimes  if I don't use the app for a few hours  it won't give new message notifications until I open the app.) Other than that  you will LOVE this app. I've been spoiled and can never use anything else. 💙💚💙💖,March 15 2017,5
No. 1,March 15 2017,5
I absolutely love this app  been using for about 3 years now. But lately (Sept)  any upload/download is excruciatingly slow. Any data transfer happens at a painful speed of around 10-30kbps while my net plan has speeds up to 50mbps(~50000kbps). A simple 1mb pic takes about 7-10 minutes to download! This has made the app completely unusable. I've tried different vpns dns changer  3 different isp WiFi and cellular Internet  no luck. PLEASE fix this asap. I'm from Karnataka  India if that's of any use...,March 15 2017,2

The app is ok...the fact that you can retract nd edit messages nd not disclose numbers is cool... But i have issues with the restriction policy.. Lets say i have issues with someone personally someone owing me money  i text them nd they report me as spam.. I feel its ok that i cant reach that particular person.. But then i cnt chat in a few groups i can't relate to friends from groups in private  i can't text friends i haven't texted in a while  for 3whole days unless they text me first.. Just because of one person..one darn person who feels its not OK for me to ask for what's mine.. That just seems unfair.. Please kindly revisit that policy Cuz people even report as spam for wrong unfair reasons most times and you claim to moderate.. Yet u just block anyone that's reported..,March 17 2017,3

Self destruct messages since forever. An attacker would need access to your device to read messages. Community driven. Everything useful included. No ads  no pay  no data scumbaggery. Devs are paranoid russians that want our stuff safe from kgb  nsa and everyone. They are stationed in Berlin  Germany  where privacy laws are great. 10/10,March 21 2017,5

Dear Telegram team  Thank you for your effort  your app satisfy me a lot  just some small thing I hope you can do to us. First  I personally like a small size font  but I had found out that only the text messages are apply to the font size we had set  but the font for musics  participants name  web contains  the contains of message we tabbed to reply are still remain the default font size which I really disappointed with. Please make all those font size apply to what we preferred. And next  please let us customize the group  for displaying head icon or hide the head icon. I prefer more wider space to display contains of the text messege  rather than more line in use to display contains of the text messege. I am willing to look forward for your respond. Thank you.,March 21 2017,3

I had lost my mb on this app. It just showed downloading and it was cancelled after some time.,March 20 2017,1
Something is seriously wrong with the setup process... Pass code initially recv'd was unable to enter as either the app or my cell auto skipped by that screen thus invalidating that code... Unable to find an answer in the FAQS messaged support asking if it would effect the functionality... Response did not answer my question and from what I can tell one can't simply enter a new pass code anywhere once installed.. Therefore uninstall  cleared cache and reinstalled.. The new code support sent obviously no longer worked and a new one was never recv'd... Another problem as when you click the pass code not received another one is sent but kicked out of the pass code screen no water to get back to it... A message in the app has a link to click if pass code not received and a timer pops up saying a rep w call you back... Clicked 2x's and no return call after waiting much longer than the less than 2 min displayed... Deleted as this is simply annoying... Had their support answered my question correctly to begin with don't think I'd be as irked wasting my time or called as didn't ask for a call back so don't add a msg saying someone will when they don't... also annoying... Work in IT and completely understand issues happen either w the app even possibly my error yet not much patience when misinformation... Delete...,March 20 2017,1

In this Apperwall review  I marked it legitimate. Overall ApperWall is an easy to use extra income site that can help you find new apps and get paid for it. I like the payment system  ApperWall has a minimum cash out amount of $.50 and pays via PayPal. Since you’ll be earning a few bucks for review  you know you can always get paid right away. If you’re interested in getting paid to review apps  ApperWall is an excellent option.,March 28 2017,5

Upset fool to download this app don't telegram has an client for it Google wear watches but right for most people like me  we don't really care about what's on the app  but for making better for our wear most people would agree. it's all about Google wear not to much about the app. So when I get a basic app that do just the basic things then it get bored pretty quick . So I'm asking where's the client for this app for my Google wear without it's own client it's worthless to me and others who prefer to text or do anything on Thier watches. Google Watches are the mobile of today link with Thier cell phones take example: Glide Google wear friendly 100%,March 28 2017,1

Tapping on a shared contact opens the number opposed to adding it to the phonebook. And if I want to call someone  tapping on a contact open up dialer with the number not even the name of saved contact. Making a call directly wouldve been less intrusive.,March 27 2017,5

The only thing keeping from being 5 stars is the lack of a way to tell when the other person has received the message. It probably isn't something you want to hear  but I like how WhatsApp handled the read receipts. Maybe implement something similar? Currently  I can't tell when they've received the message  only when they've read it.,March 27 2017,4

Very nice app. But can u make it more user-friendly for Moto users by enabling full screen reading mode. Today the mute button at the bottom (even when screen is rotated) & name of the channel with too much width consumes a lot of space. Further for Moto G4 plus  the upper strip of battery n clock + bottom strip of virtual buttons remains as it is. Hence plz make updates to enable full screen mode. I have a lot of useful data to read on it.,March 27 2017,1

The app is excellent. Could you please add a feature to put privacy on a user's Profile Pic? So that only my contacts can see my Profile Pic if I choose to do so. Maybe someone just wants to keep the profile pic to themselves. Perhaps an option to make the users profile pic visible in certain groups that the user allows. This will allow the user to have more control over who can see their profile pic and who can't. Lastly an option that enables a user to have more than one profile pic. One profile pic for private contacts. Another different profile pic for Groups etc.,March 30 2017,5

It improved from good to superb. From sticker feauture to thousands of awesome bots. The reply and forward feature and many others.

You can use it on almost any platform  and with its lightweight build  it doesn't burden older devices. The developers are keeping busy adding new functions  so you can rest assured knowing that new features are always on the way. I'd love to see an option to totally turn off """"Last Seen"""" on a per-contact basis.",March 30 2017,5
Fantastic,March 30 2017,5

I always thought telegram is better than whatsapp but now it's far ahead. Whatsapp has the advantage of time but if they won't follow soon time won't be much of help,March 30 2017,5

Telegram can be better with call,March 30 2017,5
Telegram is awesome because of custom themes  stickers and super fast gifs. And now there are calls we can make. I am officially dissing whatsapp. I am sold!!!,March 30 2017,5
ALL THOSE WHO ARE UPDATING  PLEASE READ THIS. I updated the app on 30th March  that's the latest update introducing calls and all. But I used the secret chat feature to share a picture and the recipient didn't view but it was saved automatically in the gallery. Before the recipient viewed it  I deleted it for some reason but he had it in his gallery. This app of yours promises the safety and security but where's that now? Gone for a horse ride? This actually sucks! I used to love this app but this new update's bug is just utter bullshit!,March 30 2017,1
Be care about spam,March 30 2017,2
Very powerful  much more dynamic and extensive than WhatsApp. Thanks for the themes addition!! Love the dark theme. 😍 Wohoo! Calling option introduced (30th Mar  3017),March 30 2017,5

Good app but need improvement! Downloading speed while any download file image song any...is automatically decreases than normal other app download....it may be argued that it takes consume speed in other download s but its overall consuming speed in internet speed meter is very slow .... (speed fo google play is 1.2 mbps whereas for telegram is 35 -40 kbps)solve this problem thanks,March 30 2017,3
Why not deleted message one by one and in bulk. ..it's disgusting,March 30 2017,2
Works as advertised. Slick design  ad free  doesn't nag for ratings  lots of features  and very fast and light. My only complaint is that it isn't very transparent on the security it uses  which would be a final great feather to add to their cap.,March 30 2017,5
Links don't appear as links and I can't open them either.,March 30 2017,5
Just the best messenger out there  what's better  it grows into a new social network unlike any other where the chats take the main place. I can't tell of it was intentional  but Telegram basically replaced Facebook  VK and even some big media since I can have all my news in there. With introduction of calls there isn't really any space for outdated WhatsApp and Viber  just love it.,March 30 2017,5
We need to do video and sound calls as imo and other app.,March 30 2017,3
This is an awesome app  not just a messaging app but much more. Best app ever👍,March 30 2017,5

It's good,March 30 2017,5
Best messenger app. Now with p2pp calls! Why? Clients for every device! Bots. Greatly help you  design your own. Gifs. Videos. Any data you can imagine  you can send. Great usability  open API  open source. Self destruct messages since forever. An attacker would need access to your device to read messages. Community driven. Everything useful included. No ads  no pay  no data scumbaggery. Devs are paranoid russians that want our stuff safe from kgb  nsa and everyone. They are stationed in Berlin  Germany  where privacy laws are great. 10/10,March 30 2017,5

The only problem that I get with Telegram is that sometimes it doesn't notify me for new messages. I have to open the app to find new ones. Anyway  It's an amazing messaging app  I used it all the time and encourage everyone to do it.,March 30 2017,4
Ik it'd be a big update but if only they supported voice/video calls too I'd probably not use any other messaging app  been using it since 2014 for all my messages and I love it  it being open source and free not more i would ask for Edit: and now a call update  I'm done  u guys win,March 30 2017,4

Really good application. Used by us and our Chemistry teacher for JEE based discussion and large study materials (pdf) are easily shared (their file size is no hindrance). For JEE Aspirants  this is so much better than Whatsapp... Now we can organize our online study groups w/o being disturbed by 'old friends' or relatives who don't realise the need for peace for JEE prep. Cheers devs. (For the uniniated JEE is a two stage college entrance exam for admission to the IITs and other prestigious colleges of India. Widely regarded as the toughest college entrance exam in the world  only 4995 students are selected for the old IITs (the old ones are more prestigious) out of 1.5 million aspirants),March 29 2017,4

"È sicuramente l'app del suo genere più potente: è leggera e veloce come whatsapp ma permette di inviare file di qualsiasi genere fino a 1 5GB (meglio di una mail  più di 10 foto  video lunghissimi  documenti ecc). Poi ci sono le chat segrete  che si """"autodistruggono""""(ideali per l'amante e pusher). Nonostante ciò è ancora poco diffusa tra i miei contatti. Non consiglio di installare decine di App del genere ma Telegram merita  davvero!",April 02 2017,5

A very uncomfortable and weird thing in Telegram- when I want to share a webpage or a file and choose Telegram  not other apps  i can do it only to those who are in my shortlist. But what if i have to send it to a given person for the first time??? It's unfeasible. I have to paste it manually. So that is why WhatsApp or even Hangouts are preferable when you want to share links or files with someone. Is it possible to fix the issue?,April 01 2017,4

The app is excellent. Could you please add a feature to put privacy on a user's Profile Pic? So that only my contacts can see my Profile Pic if I choose to do so. Maybe someone just wants to keep the profile pic to themselves. Perhaps an option to make the users profile pic visible in certain groups that the user allows. This will allow the user to have more control over who can see their profile pic and who can't. Lastly an option that enables a user to have more than one profile pic. One profile pic for private contacts. Another different profile pic for Groups etc.,March 31 2017,5

Only real complaint I have for the mobile version is that playing voice messages makes the phone think it's managing a call (I think) and getting close to the top sensor makes the screen black out  which funnily makes the message stop. This is also true when the voice message is paused but not (x)ed out.,April 04 2017,4

Already reported but mention here as well  cache is not deleting locally on my phone after 7 days (setting that I really would like to work) . any simple VoIP would be great!. please add Russian into settings-&gt;language.

Your app is best for type and size app to transfer and speedy comunication its very safe and secure .thanks,April 03 2017,5
Voice calls and video call please,April 03 2017,5
The app is great and fast. Needs to add video calling features  scheduled messages and tabs to separate the types of chats (one to one  groups  bots). Also enhance the location map feature to include a search of address which when a user does this can then send the info. The sound volume on notifications for desktop apps needs options for higher volume and the ability to select a custom sound. The app does keep getting better and better. Keep up the great work.,April 03 2017,4
Why I have to open the app first before receiving new message?,April 03 2017,3
Perfect  best.,April 03 2017,5
It would be nice if the notifications were ever updated to work on Nougat. For now  the app is seriously hampered if you actually want to read notifications.,April 03 2017,5

"Eccezionale come sempre. Funzionalità innovative e molto molto comode. Team al top. Mi aspettavo un arrangiamento migliore riguardo alla sistemazione delle chat. Sarò maniacale  ma il """"set on top"""" è un qualcosa in più  ma non basta. La schermata è ancora molto disordinata  se si vogliono tenere molte chat. Spero migliorerete questo aspetto in maniera più approfondita. Temi superlativi. Chiamate Eccellenti!",April 03 2017,5

This app is so fast but it notification is bad!!,April 03 2017,3
Great app. If you like Facebook messenger  then then you will love this app also. All the benefits and the best one is it isn't tied to Facebook. I only wish it would be able to access my Google photos to be able to send photos from there also. It doesn't replace your texting app. It is a stand alone app messenging. Exactly what I was looking for. The perfect Facebook messenger app replacement. Also it works simultaneously across all devices if logged into the same account. Again  only thing it is missing is access to google photos which could allow more photos to be shared within this app and you wouldn't have to have all photos locally stored on the device.,April 03 2017,4

Finally decided to dump Hangouts for Telegram. I like most of it. There are a few annoyances. Some which developers have no plans to work on. I do not like the emoji. I do not like the sound alerts on the desktop app. I do not like that mentions do not necessarily alert the user if the conversation is active. There are some other few things that are annoying. But there are a lot of things that Telegram gets right. It is available on all platforms. It's fast. It's smooth. It does not consume much RAM on the desktop. It just works great. File sharing is brilliant. Google Talk good. Stickers... Love them.,April 03 2017,4

I love Telegram!!! It's super easy to use. It's fast. You can even share all kinds of media very easily. I happen to be a total grammar nerd so when I make a typo it bothers me so much! I love that with Telegram you can edit your messages. You can even choose to delete a message from just your end or yours and your chat partner's end. More than once have I accidentally sent a random tgvujbfjedvhfdvcj text so it's easy to delete them.,April 03 2017,5

It is simply the best. It is light  has many useful features  doesn't burden the phone with huge app memory. Love the flexibility of groups and channels.

Best messaging app,April 06 2017,5
I just started using telegram today  and the app has failed the first task it's supposed to do. Import my contacts!!! If I can't see any contacts then how am I going to chat with others conveniently through this app. Major turn off. I've tried everything from your bug reporting page. Close app  restart  changed contacts to international number  changed contact name and reverted. All still lead to the same result: nothing seen in contacts. The only way I can now see contacts is by adding them manually but damn why the heck would I manually add over 100+ contacts again??? What a let down. AND I'm very sure that the contacts that I tried adding have telegram too  and obviously I've allowed the app to access my phone contacts DUHH.,April 06 2017,1

"Best messaging app ever! Add Video calling... & If possible  status message! And  an option to temporary deactivating the account!! I don't want to lose everything in my account while deactivating... Or add some options in the deactivating page! Like """"keep chats  keep «chat with yourself» section  keep channel's""""... Could you add an option to send messages at the specific time?! Something like timer on posts that i can send in private chats and channels... It can be revolutionary! 😄 why you don't add Persian language?! Need help? I'll help you!!!! Just add it ASAP please... &... When I playing a music from a channel  there's no way to tap on music and get to the channel! Make this option...",April 05 2017,5
This app could be better if i had the option of sharing my videos from my phone  if i want to share a video  i have to record a video while on the app in order to send it  which seems stupid since i can share pictures from my phone gallery but not videos  fix that little issue and the app will be alot better  but for now  its only worth 2 stars  3 at the most,April 05 2017,2

Please add a feature in which the size of emojis can be modified just as the size of the font can. Also  on group chats could there be some sort of thing that could let us know who read the messages? (Update: I'm so happy that Telegram calls have finally come  but could the sounds for like calling and ending the call be different? I mean it's just not really subtle for the ears and well I don't know if this is important or anything but personally I find it really annoying to hear but that's just me I guess. Also whenever you take a photo through Telegram  it always appears to be really sharp and edgy. Please fix.),April 09 2017,4

If only there are 2 ways to log in to telegram. Like a choice between logging in using your mobile number or EMAIL ADDRESS. That would be much safer since we dont need to worry about giving away our personal number just to add a contact to our list.. yes you can give away your ID but if you start saving numbers  your number will also be shown to theirs. Thats quite a downer since you boast on super secured messaging app. But over all  this app is by far the best messaging app.,April 09 2017,5

Why iran is last country to get update?? Voice call just for eroupe africa south and north america and about asia???😐😐 so 1 star for this discrimination,April 09 2017,1
App looks good. I will give 4 star when you improve adding new contacts to contacts list. At present i would say adding contacts from my phone book is almost impossible this app if i am not wrong. App is asking to enter new contact number. Who remembers or write down contact numbers now a days. Even if i entered a new contact number it sending only invitation but not added to my telegram contact list. Pl Rectify this big mistake. You made it to protect privacy of the user but it is a blunder. Thanks.,April 09 2017,3

Voice messages are playing louder on low volume and can't be turned down. The voice messages break while playing. Loved the app but if it can't be fixed soon  I'll have to switch to another app.,April 08 2017,3

You insult us you&#39;re like most users telegram Iranian and Persian are officially still telegram added at least sewers your application to developers manager of facilities new telegram entitled Voice call also added that this program is not yet active in Asia,April 08 2017,5

Calls were working good  but now it's just ringing and disconnect.,April 08 2017,5
It's a good apps. Powerful file sharing with fast downloading. The new theme is cool giving us an option to choose either to use the default theme or new theme. But there is a problem in which we can't customize our notification tone either for individual or group notification. Please fix this and let us enjoy the ultimate Telegram experience.,April 08 2017,4
There are some problems with voice calls: the sound is very late and the echo is heard.,April 08 2017,3

Telegram is a fantastic app/platform that easily can compete with WhatsApp. My big issue with it on Android is that notifications don't work. They apparently don't use Android's built in notification system  instead choosing to roll their own (as is the case with their encryption as well). While I'm all for innovation  the system simply doesn't work. While using this app  I missed over 60% of the message notifications  and wasn't aware I had received a message until I opened the app. Since this is a messaging app  that obviously won't do. If it weren't for this one problem  and they used a tried and proven encryption method  this would 100% be my go-to messaging app. I still love it  but the fact that notifications don't consistently work is unfortunately enough for me to not use the app.,April 11 2017,3
keep it up,April 11 2017,5
Very easy to use this feature,April 11 2017,4
It's OK. It seems to works as described.,April 11 2017,3

"After 10 days  still there's no voice call in Asia and Iran! Add Video calling... & If possible  status message! And  an option to temporary deactivating the account!! I don't want to lose everything in my account while deactivating... Or add some options in the deactivating page! Like """"keep chats  keep «chat with yourself» section  keep channel's""""... Could you add an option to send messages at the specific time?! Something like timer on posts that i can send in private chats and channels... It can be revolutionary! 😄 why you don't add Persian language?! Need help? I'll help you!!!! Just add it ASAP please... &... When I playing a music from a channel  there's no way to tap on music and get to the channel! When i tap on a profile in the contacts list after pressing the back button it show the first contact! unlike the chat screen that stay on the last message that you read... Fix it pls",April 11 2017,5
I love this app!! I have been using this app for 2.8 years. It's always better every other leading messengers. Other messengers copied delivered option  encryption  stickers n what not from TELEGRAM . Only Missing thing was call.. Now it's perfect!!,April 11 2017,5

Voice calling is finally here! And the call quality seems to be better than WhatsApp. Awesome stuff! One feature request that I still want very badly: please add an option in group settings to toggle user avatars in chat off and on.

"The sheer customization potential and expansion of Telegram is nearly unlimited  with thousands of channels and bots  plus lightning fast and secure messaging. You can use it on almost any platform  and with its lightweight build  it doesn't burden older devices. The developers are keeping busy adding new functions  so you can rest assured knowing that new features are always on the way. I'd love to see an option to totally turn off """"Last Seen"""" on a per-contact basis.",April 11 2017,5

Definitly this is a perfect OTT app and everything works perfectly with  somehow  good speed. But still I have problem with notifictions on my Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 device. I expect notification settings for users or groups should overwrite general settings(just like previous versions) but as I disable alert generally and enable it for some of my contacts  no notification is recieved. It overwrites for sound or vibration type but not for having or not having notification.,April 13 2017,4

5* for crystal clear calls 5* for Inline bots. @gif is simply awesome !! 5* for directly reply to conversations. 5* for not clogging my phone with all shared medias. 5* It's so light and feature rich. 5* being independent from availability of my mobile data to use it non-mobile. 5* for #tagging and @id addressing,April 16 2017,5

"The quality of voice call is great! Even i can say  better than WhatsApp!! Add Video calling... & If possible  status message! And  an option to temporary deactivating the account!! I don't want to lose everything in my account while deactivating... Or add some options in the deactivating page! Like """"keep chats  keep «chat with yourself» section  keep channel's""""... Could you add an option to send messages at the specific time?! Something like timer on posts that sends automatically in a certain time... It can be revolutionary! 😄 why you don't add Persian language?! Need help? I'll help you!!!! Just add it ASAP please... &... When I playing a music from a channel  there's no way to tap on music and get to the channel! or when i click on the photo from """"Shared Media"""" there's no option to get to that message on the channel... When i tap on a profile in the contacts list after pressing the back button it show the first contact! unlike the chat screen that stay on the last message that you read... Fix it pls  thanks & keep it up...",April 16 2017,5

"The quality of voice call is great! Even i can say  better than WhatsApp!! Add Video calling... & If possible  status message! And  an option to temporary deactivating the account!! Video compression doesn't work  it's increase the file size! I don't want to lose everything in my account while deactivating... Or add some options in the deactivating page! Like """"keep chats  keep «chat with yourself» section  keep channel's""""... Could you add an option to send messages at the specific time?! Something like timer on posts that sends automatically in a certain time... It can be revolutionary! 😄 why you don't add Persian language?! Need help? I'll help you!!!! Just add it ASAP please... &... When I playing a music from a channel  there's no way to tap on music and get to the channel! or when i click on the photo from """"Shared Media"""" there's no option to get to that message on the channel... When i tap on a profile in the contacts list after pressing the back button it show the first contact! unlike the chat screen that stay on the last message that you read...

La aplicación está excelente  la uso desde sus inicios sin importar quien la use de mis amistades  es mi favorita. Con las nuevas actualizaciones va de maravilla y los felicito  han realizado un gran avance. Por último actualice la beta con los mini video chats y bajó un poco la calidad con la modalidad de cámara trasera  espero mejore en futuras versiones. De resto ok.

Useful and pretty functional. Bots make it fun to use group chats,April 17 2017,5
I don't get it. You claim privacy but ask for a phone number? Interesting how GetGems can function on your platform fully supported only by usernames  no phone numbers. You can't even login to Telegram with your username  you need the exact same phone number every time. Ridiculous to think you'll only have that Telegram account with that username as long as you have the phone number. Apparently you have to supply phone logs and bills to prove you had that phone number of you lose it  so you can recuperate your Telegram account. Ridiculous. I'm going back to GetGems.,April 17 2017,1

"So far telegram is the best messaging app I have seen.. but to attract more users  telegram team should do something like """"status for whatsapp"""". But do it in a different manner.. you can allow the users to set gif as well as pics for dp(do not remove multiple dp option).. Under that add a description """"about myself"""" under that users can update their job qualifications  or little details about their business etc.. I know this will take a lot of storage space  but I hope that will help to attract more users..",April 20 2017,5

It doesn't always send you notifications right away when someone messages you even though I have it set up to notify me in the settings. Sometimes it doesn't notify me that someone sent me a message from up to 1 to 6 hours later. I have to keep checking back to see if I got new messages and that is very annoying. Other than that everything else works well.,April 22 2017,3

Used to work flawlessly. Lately the app is very glitchy. I find myself having to restart my device in order for issue to be resolved. The issue I'm having is that when I lift my device to my ear to record a message the message never records. Update as of 4/21/17 Listening to and recording by lifting device to ear has become even more buggy. Very frustrating as I have reinstalled the app several times now.,April 21 2017,2

Encryption,April 21 2017,4
Username must be 5 characters long. Not good  since my usual username is only 4 characters... Other than that  it seems to be a good app  and way better than fb messenger bloatware.,April 21 2017,3
The developer despite being told by known experts in cryptography that their implementation is bad the developer has not fixed the security  their end to end encryption is useless.I will re-rate the app when the developer fixes those issues in security  the design and usage for communication is great the team just needs to fix the most important issues on security.,April 21 2017,1

Great app. Very fast. Good for group chats as well as personal chats. The best thing about telegram is that the files are not stored in the phones memory but on the cloud which makes it thousand times better than other apps coz you dont have to constantly delete files from your phones memory. Overall the best messaging app. I thing instead of using the by default messaging apps  people should switch to telegram. Love this app.,April 24 2017,5

Great messaging service and one of the smaller size ones. However my biggest gripe with it is that I personally like the automatic download picture option but WHY does it save images I send. When I look through my gallery I often find duplicate images where telegram had saved content I send. Other than that it's great.,April 26 2017,4

Crazy good app! 🙌 I'm telling all my friends about it. And I love the stickers. Great that I can also use the app on my PC. I have an idea: how about a reminder feature to help you remember to write something to a specific person on a specific date? Or a send later option. I sometimes think that would be great. I also know that some of my friends don't know that they can edit or delete messages. Maybe you should send another notice somehow for those who don't read the changelogs.,April 26 2017,5

Its a perfect app but few users  if only they know how nice telegram is. To developer i hope theres a way to group bot and channels so it wont interfere my contacts. When my friend send me an audio  i hope the title is the same so I can fin it easilly.,May 01 2017,5

Why am I automatically joining some channels??? It is a significant security issue! I do not want to be joined channels without any action from my side. What is going on in the telegram?? Please give us an ability to filter channels  no one should be able to subscribe us to channels on behalf of us. An update can fix this and we can disable joining channels manually.,May 01 2017,1

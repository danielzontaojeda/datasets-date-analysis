Improvements needed 1. It needs to recognise when something else is talking! If the Google App is reading out a search result  TalkBack should not read out the same text simultaneously but at a slightly different speed! It should talk only when it has exclusive use of the audio. 2. Whose bright idea was it to change the default gestures? Unless you know the new gestures  you can't navigate to the setting to restore your old preferences! Needs a pop screen asking if you want new defaults or not.,November 06 2016,3

Can plug into cell and maybe a bluetooth program (better). Bluetooth speakers work bi-directionally so a handset also could.

Great improvement over last version For those that say that TalkBack is annoying  and should not be installed on devices  think how you would feel if the rest of the world could access all this wonderful technology that we have  but you could not. On Android  TalkBack is an essential app for a blind person to navigate the mobile world. TalkBack works very well for me  and I use it everyday. The only thing that I would ask Google  is please better trained your support technicians on the use of TalkBack.,November 04 2016,4

I Tried This Add In For Awhile. I decided to change to stand-alone systems as I hoped that they would be more independent than the addin model above. The track record I had with the addin was not pleasant in the end as it was bribed by outside influences and I was forced to shut her down. She admitted to the act of bribery happening  but refused to reveal who the bribor was. It then I shut her down. I am now using stand alone systems to a better outcome.,October 26 2016,3

Great  but has small annoying bug. Problem: Letter is auto repeating even key is depressed  when using Physical keyboard  either Bluetooth or wired keyboard via OTG. Open text editor app. Type something. Suspend Talkback using Ctrl+Alt+Z Continue typing  and the problem occurs. Temporary solution : Switch off Talkback service from Setiings -&gt; Accessibility -&gt; Talkback and switch it oON back. But  no problem to suspend Talkback using Vol+ Vol-   on media keys on the keyboard. N6P  NPF10C,October 20 2016,5

"Stupid to rate this app Ratings are to help people decide if they are going to download an app  so to rate a mandatory app that we cannot remove is just plain stupid. 2nd off this app is made for the visually impaired so to ask the average user how well it works for visually impaired is inappropriate. But then again the average person rates their """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""average app"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as four star meaning above average so so ratings of apps in general are ignorantly misused and therefore wildly inaccurate in the first place.""""",October 14 2016,3

I thought this was the function I had on my S4 that reads your texts aloud. It was the most annoying thing ever couldn't control it. Why did Samsung do away with that feature it can save lives on the road for business people who need to hear texts in the car. Dumb move I have a J7 Even my friends with better Samsung phones don't have the read aloud text feature. Dumb.,October 06 2016,1

Im in constant growth of GB's of data space from apps not needing or wqnting  or an update to a flaw that still remains even qfter additional space needed for an update.  it's Nonsense  Besides my cheap LG Optimus F3 that cost $89.00 3 yrs ago already has a voice that speqks and does what i ask  Nany Nany Boo Boo Stik ur head in Doo Doo!,October 06 2016,1

I would like to give this app 5 stars  but I cannot. TalkBack no longer reads the caller I. D. for my phone.

Without any shadow of doubt in this world (or the next)  this is the worst app that I have stumbled upon in my whole life. If you are very profoundly disabled (which  fortunately  I am not)  I fully accept that it (just) may be the best thing since sliced bread. But if you are NOT so disabled  then do yourself a massive favour  and RUN A MILE!! Why?? Because once you have downloaded it onto your phone or laptop  you will find it is the worst anti-social virus you have ever experienced. I absolutely HATE it!!!! It almost makes me wish that I had never been born!!! This so called 'app' makes me wish that I did not own a mobile cell phone! The one that I used to own (before I discovered this app)  I went to the expense of hiring an expensive digger  to enable me to crush it beyond all recognition. And I then started again - without this life-destroyer.,October 04 2016,1

Sound Feedback I love this version. I'm just wondering  maybe it's just me  if the sound feedback couldn't be more subtle? I'm not a great fan of the sounds  but as  for some reason  my vibrating feedback seams to have a mind of it's own  (or maybe it's my phone)  I have to use the sound feedback  and it irritates me very quickly. As I said  maybe it's just me. But either than that  talk back is of great help to me.,September 30 2016,5

Google Talk Back Why does 90% of the people who complain about the Google Talk Back App  are the whine asses that don't even use the dam thing to begin with anyways? You people don't even know what it does for people that have a hard time seeing  even with prescription glasses! But instead of only thinking about yourselves  why don't you think about the people that it is helping out tremendously on an everyday basis? God  people are just so inconsiderate nowadays  that it's really not worth even bothering with them!,September 27 2016,5

Please Add a TalkBack Widget! Much improved from 4 years ago! Thank you for improving this app. My only pet peeve now is that there is no TalkBack widget and the two-step shortcut in stock Android on a Nexus 6p is rather cumbersome  and if you don't time it right you accidentally end up turning the phone off! Please add a widget so that low vision users can toggle Talkback on and off with the press of ONE button  or add the ability for users to turn TalkBack on and off with Google Now.,September 24 2016,4

*I'm not visually impaired so I don't need this TalkBack is an accessibility service that helps blind and vision-impaired users interact with their devices. *I'm not visually impaired so I don't need this. TalkBack adds spoken  audible  and vibration feedback to your device. TalkBack comes pre-installed on most Android devices. * at least give people the option to disable this app if it's not needed... It's always updating  for what purpose if you don't use it.,December 14 2016,1

Excellent app  stop hating on this This app works very well for its purpose and deserves 5‚òÖ. If you don't wish to use it then it can be disabled on your device and will use zero RAM as it does not run  and you will never be asked yo update this app in the Play Store. The factory installed app base will still occupy &lt; 5 MB storage which is acceptable.

Could be better The one thing I don't like about this app is  it simply is that it makes it harder to use your phone it would be helpful if the same configurations that is working when its off would work when it's on and I'm referring to the navigation function so that I can one finger across the screen changes the screen instead of having to touch with two fingers to move the screen when the original configuration is better in other words used the phone's original configuration and add descriptive features.,December 20 2016,3

It turns on every time I turn my phone on!!!!! It turns on at start up for no reason. You need to fix this asap!!!!! It is extremely annoying! I have no use for this app. So I shouldn't have to turn it off every time I turn my phone on!!! I even disabled it and it still turns on.,December 20 2016,1

Locked phone For an older phone forced to update this app can take up most ram and bog down the os... if its accidentally turned on it will slow the phone down so much I can't get past the lock screen  then it just talks to me in ceaselessly mocking monotones. Or often activities on its own and is an over all nightmare to try and delete... with out exaggeration I'd say the worst And most frustratingly useless app that google rooted into my Android...,December 20 2016,1
Caused volume control to fail After accidentally launching the confusing settings for this app  the volume control button on my Pixel failed except in safe mode (and Pixel 24 hour support had no idea how to fix it besides tediously disabling/enabling apps -- irritating when I found out it was this app that caused the problem).,December 20 2016,1

Google Talk Back Disable this piece of crap and get it off my phone. Does your support not actually read reviews. Where is the how to disable this app option to get this off my phone ?,December 23 2016,1
One more bloatware from Google.,December 23 2016,1
It's broken  let me delete it! Latest version of the app stops my volume buttons from working and I can't even delete the app!,December 23 2016,1

Google talkback Useful but troublesome. It should have voice selection support.,December 23 2016,2
Broke My Volume Buttons I'm on the Nexus 6P running Android 7.1.1. After Talkback was automatically installed  my volume buttons no longer worked. Screenshots worked fine (using the volume down button) and the volume changes when the screen is completely off but when the screen is on nothing happened. Not even the volume menu appeared when the buttons were pressed. The issue was fixed immediately upon uninstalling Talkback without any reboots or other updates.,December 23 2016,1

Breaks sound locker First of all  the majority of people with android don't even use this. It might be useful if you are blind but most people aren't and we can't even uninstall it. I have a nexus 5X and since the update every time I restart my phone it says TalkBack has stopped. If I go back then I can no longer change my sound volume. Fix this soon because I've looked at the other reviews and there are many others reporting the same problem and it is very annoying!üò§,January 05 2017,1

App interferes with Google pixel App continues to auto download everytime I uninstall the app. I uninstall it because as well the app itself interferes with the volumes buttons on the Google pixel. If the app is installed the buttons are rendered useless. If the app is not installed they work fine. This app is worthless until they fix it and it's troubling that it downloads without the users permission. Especially after they uninstalled it.,January 07 2017,1

I have a nexus 5X and since the update every time I restart my phone it says TalkBack has stopped. If I go back then I can no longer change my sound volume.

TalkBack It interferes with volume controls,January 13 2017,1
Unacceptably buggy Speech feedback frequently stutters or fails to work and sometimes plays audio through headphones and speakers. It also has trouble with volume  being much quieter than it should be. Perhaps the most frustrating part is trying to lower the notification shade. I frequently have to pull down on the shade 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or even 8 or 9 times before it descends fully. Of course I don't have a choice. I have to use it whether I like it or not since that's the only way I can interact with my phone,January 13 2017,2
It's ok Really good job,January 13 2017,3

I want to get rid of this off my phone. Alex Peterson.You obviously do not know how these preloaded apps work. I disabled this and various other google apps on my lg phone.

Great app for the blind. Horrible nightmare for the hearing impaired. Every time I reboot my phone I have to fight this thing while disturbing all my neighbors to get to the menu to turn this off. Should absolutely come with a permanently disable option that requires a code to reactivate.

I am not blind  but I was curious and I tried the app using the phone with the eyes closed. Although I can't give a consistent opinion about the functionality  because I didn't use it for a long time  I can suggest that you add a feature that recognises languages so the robot can read the text properly. I am constantly reading and writing in Portuguese and English and I found that this might be difficult for blind people to do if this app doesn't have this feature.,January 28 2017,4

Pre-installed app on Samsung Galaxy 3 & I didn't need it so I started by turning it off. However  any time the phone is restarted the app starts up as well & tells me so by placing a left hand print in the corner of my screen. Got so annoyed w/it (& the process of having to go in to the settings  go thru 3 steps to turn it off  not to mention having the app yell at me if I forgot to turn my volume off) that I disabled the app but it's STILL happening! So  now I've come here to re-enable the stupid app just so that I can shut it off again because since disabling it  it doesn't show up in the settings anymore but still  somehow gets activated. I'm sure it serves its purpose well for those who truly need it & I think it's a great idea  but for me it's just a nuisance. It can't be uninstalled  just disabled but clearly that doesn't work. Any suggestions would be great...please help!!!,February 06 2017,1

The application is life but it will be better if the TalkBack can create the contacts or do some other functions on only the voice command of the users because for the blind persons to find the buttons on the screens it's a little difficult and it should improve its what we can say Internet searching ability while editing the dialogue box by voice input there is no future to edit by inserting the full stop Sir comma App making the paragraph can you add it in the TalkBack feature,February 15 2017,5

If this app is by mistake opened or activated then you have to run a software to deactivate it which costs around ‚Çπ250-‚Çπ300 averaged in India . Once it's ON A then you cannot switch off by your own handling like swiping the screen. The only first part which a screen shows of the menu is accessible. If you tried to swipe it down or swipe Right to access view another menu icons you cannot unless you deactivated by a software from mobile shop. If it got activated then understand your mobile will stay hang forever or fucked..... Hated it,March 02 2017,1

This app is a great concept and I am happy to have it but it has its flaws. The predictive text as always anticipating what I might say because I used the same type of conversations but many times it will miss type words or put in what it thinks I said. When I end a sentence it will write out the word question mark or the word period or whatever else I need to use. Unfortunately I am always stopping and have to erase what the app puts in and sometimes it won't even type anything in. Speak very clearly into this app but it has its own mind sometimes,March 03 2017,3

They want us to spend more time on our phones and devices and allow these apps & softwares to function do everything a human can do. Im a human i dont need a robot to do things for me.

This is by far the worst application I have ever had on my phone. It literally will not do a single thing. I tell it to text someone it says that they sent the text but the text is never sent I tell them I want to go to work and they say okay going to work but then it never takes me to work the map won't even load nothing works.

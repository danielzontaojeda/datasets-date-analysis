I have synced it multiple times, and tried every fix offered on Apple support. Finally made an appointment at the Apple store this weekend and advised by the Apple tech the iPad is toast. It has a hardware issue and cannot be repaired. I contacted Square Deals Inc. the company I purchased the iPad through Amazon from, and was advised the iPad is out of warranty after only 9 months.

B01CR1FQMG,Stacy,5,"April 3, 2017",True,All good so far.,"TLDR: Great phone, looks new. Pay attention to who the seller is when you make your choice - the seller changes when you choose a different color. I bought from BuySPRY. All good so far. I was incredibly hesitant to buy a refurbished phone on Amazon after reading so many negative reviews on various products. I spent a lot of time researching my options and figured this one was probably my safest bet. Phone came in perfect condition (seriously, it looks brand new) and so far all the functions seem great. Set up was easy, unlocked, ready to set my fingerprint and everything. It's fast, sleek, and beautiful. Camera and audio are also great. What I learned: who the seller is is very important. Although all the phones on here are iPhone 6S 64GB, when you select a different color, the seller changes. When you scroll down and look at the section ""Compare to similar items"", you will see who the phone is sold by. Looking at the reviews, most of the negative reviews seemed to be associated with the Space Gray more than the other colors. I then looked rating of each seller for each color of the iPhone 6S 64GB and went from there. As of the time of this review, the Space Gray is listed as ""Item Under Review"" because of the customer feedback.",1.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 6S, 64GB, Rose Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)"

B01CR1FQMG,Amazon Customer,1,"October 24, 2017",True,DEFECTIVE BATTERY & CAMERA - I do not trust them and don't think you should either.,"The product was defective and I wish I had chosen another retailer. It's not too late for you. 1. DEFECTIVE BATTERY - The phone was defective the day it arrived. The battery does not hold a charge consistently or indicate how long it will actually last. This defect is sporadic‚Äîso sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I thought I was doing something wrong at first so, after a few weeks of frustration, I did a test to see: tracking how long I charged and how long it lasted. This confirmed it was not my fault or a defective charger and that the phone I purchased from Electonic Deals was the problem. 2. QUESTIONABLE SECURITY - Since the day it arrived, I've had someone trying 'access the phone' remotely who is not me. I have never experienced this when I purchased a new phone or one from a credible phone reseller. 3. DEFECTIVE CAMERA - The camera stopped working entirely with no clear cause as I did not drop or damage it in any way prior to this malfunction (however, to be honest, I did scratch it in the corner but this was ironically just last week). All these problems lead to some unfortunate experiences. An unreliable phone can leave you stranded in dangerous situations: Once I charged the phone all day at work, and left late at night so I called a cab. The Electonic Deals phone died by the time I was outside, leaving me locked out and stranded. The cab never came and I had to walk through the city by myself at midnight. It can also risk your job: I had a 100% charge before going to bed so I did not plug it in to charge (reasonable) and it died before the morning so my alarm did not ring. I was late to work several times because of this and ended up buying an old alarm clock. Why didn't I send it back immediately? - Initially, I was not sure the battery issue was a defect. I tend to trust sellers and waited to verify this before accusing Electronic Deals of making a bad sale. - The requests to access my info made me not trust sending it back. Maybe it was Electonic Deals and, if I sent the phone back, I would be at risk of identity theft. I still don't trust this and will bring it to a techy friend to clear my data... - A cell phone is no small purchase. The time between returning it, receiving my money back, and purchasing a new one would leave me disconnected and out 1K. - Once I did confirm this, I had come up with a system: use it only when needed, carry an external battery and always have it plugged in when at work, home and near a power source. Ignore the requests from the mysterious person and hope for the best. Once the camera died, it was very doomed and clear I had been swindled by Electonic Deal. Note: After many emails, the company eventually said I could return the phone‚Äî however, they included terms that essentially negated the offer to take it back. Maybe the return terms were a mistake and they will send me my money back in full. However, I've received no gestures of good faith or indication that they sell working products or do fair business. I may have to take the $500 loss because it was my choice to test instead of returning immediately. So my advice is to pick another seller and, if you run into ANY issue, RETURN THE ELECTRONIC DEALS PRODUCT IMMEDIATELY. Rate them 1 star. As of this point, I do not trust them and don't think you should either. Also, if you have suggestions for another more credible retailer please share it with me in the comments so I can find a new working phone!",237.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 6S, 64GB, Rose Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)"

This was my second time purchasing this item, as the first iPhone 6s I purchased also had a problem with the camera. I strongly advise against buying a refurbished phone and will never do so again. Basically you are taking a gamble for your money. I thought I was saving money, but I wasted time, energy, and money in the long run. And do NOT buy from MyWit.",54.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 6S, 64GB, Rose Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)"
B01CR1FQMG,Anon,5,"March 22, 2019",True,Super Satisfied,"I'm going to do a blunt review: 1. The phone came in three days, which was an awesome surprise because it had originally said 7. 2. The phone is looks new. No scratches, no dents. 3. It didn't come charged and booted up in about 5 minutes after plugging it in. 4. The phone WAS unlocked and the original language preference was set to Spanish. Aha. 5. It took a bit of ""oomf"" to open the sim card tray. I was a tad nervous after multiple attempts, but I pushed just a bit harder on the last try and the tray basically fell out. 6. About the battery: My battery health is at 81%. I've used it for about 3 hours at a rapid pace, downloading apps, setting stuff up -- and it did drain a tad, but I wouldn't expect anything different. I can bet money that it'll stay charged for at least another 4-5 hours with minimal usage. For anyone complaining about the battery, it's because of one or both reasons: A. You're simply glued to it and won't put it down. B. You have notifications on for everything, maybe maximum brightness, maybe multiple widgets? I highly recommend keeping these off, but I can't speak for everyone. What I do know is this: If you NEED all of those things, I'd recommend replacing the battery with something new. You can grab a DIY replacement for about $20 - you do NOT need to go to Apple for their specific battery. If you're like me that really could careless about having notifications/multiple widgets/etc on, the battery is literally FINE. 7. The device is extremely responsive and FAST. 8. It looks and feels sleek - was even thinner then I expected. 9. The rose-gold color is beautiful. 10. The device came with 5gb used out of 64gb. After downloading an intense amount of apps, I've used 7.4gb/64. Pretty awesome to not have to worry about space! 11. I think the price-point is fantastic for what you're getting. Yes, in about 2 years, updates will stop releasing on this model phone. However, considering how little malware lingers on iOS, I think it's safe to say the phone will last as long as you take care of it. 12. The camera is gorgeous, and the front-facing camera is one of the best I've seen to date. 13. The headphone jack works, the speakers work, the thumbprint lock works. 14. The phone is compatible with T-Mobile and AT&T. I'm really unsure about the others. 15. Don't go crazy over the negative reviews. I was starting to psyche myself out and almost didn't buy it, but i'm happy I did. Should anything not be up-to-par, I'm sure it's either fixable or returnable.",40.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 6S, 64GB, Rose Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)"

B01GXAT0CE,Alexander Lindsay,5,"May 31, 2018",True,"Great price, great phone, and great quality (and a warning)","This phone was about half the price of a new IPhone SE, and replaced one that I bought that was run over by a semi truck (long story.) It included a wall charger and phone cord (it didn't include headphones), and a brand new looking IPhone. It only had 1 minor scratch on the back of the phone. However, since it is a refurbished item, I would think the quality can vary from device to device. WARNING: As it is a used item, I would recommend THOROUGHLY inspecting the item. Running screen checks, a battery capacity test, checking for water damage, checking the IMEI, looking to see if the seller has a high rating, the works. (if any of that sounds confusing, just look up those terms to check out what they mean. It takes about 15 minutes or less to perform your total check, but you save literally 100's of dollars. If that sounds like a lot of work, think of it as paying yourself $200 for 15 minutes of work! If you make $600 an hour, sure, buy a new phone. If not, there's no reason not to get this one!) If your phone passes your inspections, great! you just banked a few hundred dollars and have a shiny, new-to-you phone to use. In the unlikely event the IPhone ISN'T up to spec, simply contact the seller. You get 90 days to solve the problem, so you can return it if theres a problem a few months down the road. My experience was fantastic, and I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a new phone",188.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone SE, 16GB, Rose Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)"

B01GXAT0CE,R C.,5,"December 4, 2018",True,Much Better Than Expected,"I wanted a second phone as a backup to my iPhone SE. So I decided to buy another one just like it. The SE is just the right size and performance for me, but sadly they have discontinued the model. I found the 64gb Space Gray Unlocked unit as a refurbished product at a good price from a seller called MyWit. It was a Prime item fulfilled by Amazon which I always look for. I had heard some horror stories about buying ""refurbished"" phones, so I contacted the seller with some questions. These were answered promptly and courteously, even though it was the weekend. Based on the contact with the seller, I made the purchase on a Sunday. My phone arrived on Tuesday afternoon, and I was surprised to find that it was in a sealed Verizon carton that said ""Certified Pre-Owned"". Everything inside looked new, and was wrapped in plastic and shipped with plastic film on it to protect the screen. I could not find a single mark on it that would indicate it was used. It came with a genuine Apple charging cord/power adapter. I had some concerns about whether it was really unlocked or not since it came from Verizon, and whether or not it would work on AT&T since my carrier is GSM and not CDMA. The seller had assured me the phone would work with either. I also wanted a second phone I could use when I go overseas. I'm a phone dummy. I know how to talk and text on them and not much more, but I followed the on-screen prompts on power up and simply placed the new phone next to my existing iPhone. In about 45 minutes the new phone had updated itself to the latest IOS version and transferred everything from my old phone, leaving all my things intact on my original phone. Very cool. Then the final test was to see if it was really unlocked. I put my AT&T SIM card from my original phone in the new phone, and at first it said ""No Service"" and I was disappointed. But in less than 30 seconds, the phone found service on AT&T and I was able to make a call. So, the phone really was unlocked, and worked on a GSM carrier. Excellent! So far I am incredibly pleased with how this worked out and with the seller. I paid $179.99 for the phone on Prime, which I think is incredibly fair given its condition and the fact that I paid more than $500 for the same phone just 2 years ago. If anything changes in further testing I'll update my review.",93.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone SE, 16GB, Rose Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)"
B01GXAT0CE,Victoria C.,5,"August 14, 2018",True,"Excellent refurbished (or new??) iPhone se from vendor, Breed","First,and important when you are considering a refurbished item, the vendor of this phone was Breed. The vendor is all-important, as they are sometimes the refurbisher, other times, they chose the refurbisher. The quality of the repairs and what sorts of phones are passed on to the customer depend on the refurbisher and the vendor. Please, folks, when you order through an Amazon vendor, mention the name of the vendor in your review. This will help other shoppers to identify which vendor you received good or bad products from, and who was responsible. We have had this refurbished 16 gb iPhone se for two weeks now, and it is an excellent replacement for my husband‚Äôs iPhone 5, which he had lost (the previous phone showed up behind the bed in a motel room we had stayed in, after nearly a week, so we were able to use the sim from our previous phone). The se model phone is a wonderful replacement, and was in like-new condition, with a Verizon sticker on the back. We took it to t-mobile to be sure it would update and transfer all settings etc from the previous phone, and the CSR could not have been more gracious and helpful. After two weeks, it is clear, the condition and performance of the phone are as good as the phone‚Äôs appearance. It arrived with a new, non-Apple charger and cable, but that is fine, we still have the charger from the previous phone, and have replaced our cables with lifetime warranty Anker cables (also available on Amazon - read the reviews). We are pleased with this phone, and would not hesitate to order refurbished equipment again from this vendor. I will mention, our iPhone 5 is still in great condition, after 4 years. It really does help to get a good case and screen covers for the phone, as they provide excellent protection from the inevitable bumps and falls.",76.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone SE, 16GB, Rose Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)"

Once it was fully charged, it started glitching out. It would crash, then cycle through the boot process indefinitely without success. Occasionally (after up to 1.5 hrs of cycling - see video for example), it would boot up and I would get it unlocked, only to have it crash as soon as it had to process a simple request (like receiving a text message or opening Settings). I couldn't connect it to my computer long enough to back up my data. I also couldn't get it to connect to iCloud to turn off Find My iPhone so I could erase it. I had to log into my iCloud from a friend's device and report the phone as missing/stolen and wipe it remotely so I could return it. If I hadn't been tech savvy enough to do that, I'm sure I would have had to return it with all my data still on it. I hate to say it, but it felt like an information hack/identity theft move to me.

If you want a FULLY functioning iPhone you should probably buy one from a different seller. Just my two cents. UPDATE #1: I sent out an email to Blutek and I did not get a reply. Even worse, the speaker blasts static for a brief moment when I raise the volume. It only happened once and hopefully it doesn't happen again.

B01N4IHGHI,Jordan,1,"July 25, 2019",True,The worst seller we have ever dealt with on Amazon,"We contacted this company several times since we purchased an iPhone from them, both during the 90 day window, and outside of it. Their service has been absolutely useless. In my latest exchange with the company, I asked that they please provide an unlock code, as the phone is apparently tethered to AT&T's network's, and AT&T advised us to ask the seller for a code. We somehow missed that fact when we purchased the phone, unfortunately. The seller's flat response now is that they refuse to provide any answers to questions, or any support outside the ""90 day window"". We have purchased many other products through Amazon in the past, and had companies even replace defective products that were well outside 90 days - some even committing that they provide support for the life of the product! Amazon is a wonderful forum, and we are grateful for their platform - but this is a bad seller. I recommend steering clear of them and purchasing your iPhones through a different vendor on the Amazon platform. With regard to this product which we purchased through this vendor, we have now been advised by AT*T that the IMEI number is not even associated with an AT&T phone; although they advertise it is tethered to the AT&T network. We have never been able to activate this phone through any vendor since we purchased it last October, but have only been able to use it on WiFi networks using Google hangouts. We are basically the proud owners of a $175 paperweight, and the seller could care less. What a disappointing Amazon experience.",1.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 6S, 16GB, Gold - For AT&T (Renewed)"

I purchased this phone on September 7th and I just contacted the seller today, November 19th because the phone is breaking. The silence button is broken and will turn off/on without even flipping it. Brushing against it causes the volume to either go up or down. The audio jack works to an extent but if I turn the earbuds/aux it will get quiet or with earbuds, if I turn it on accident it sets the volume all the way up. Both the ringer and the earbud problem have gotten me in trouble in class multiple times. The battery went from lasting three days without being recharged to dying in a matter of hours. I was so excited for this phone and love it so much but these problems are going to get me in trouble with my dad since he spent so much on it. Thank god for that 90 day limited warrenty.

I don't have to talk super slow and it gets everything I say 100% right. However, my phone will not hold it's charge.

Decided to do what I should have done in the first place and trade in for a brand new phone. Not worth the hassle and headache.,4.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 7, 128GB, Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)"
B01N9YO1DS,Debra Shek,5,"August 14, 2019",True,CAN BE USED ON ANY CARRIER ESPECIALLY VERIZON (NOTE: CARRIER MUST BE GSM COMPATIBLE),"I bought this for my network VERIZON and worked flawlessly, BUT you have to have a sim card, if you dont, you have to go to verizon and have them get you one. I saw A REVIEW on here that says not compatible with VERIZON, this is untrue, because she said she was on the phone with verizon for an hour. I know that shes wrong because there is no need to call verizon, just take the sim out of your current phone and pop into the iphone, and boom done. If you dont have a sim, you have to GO to a verizon store, they CANT give you a sim over the PHONE. ALSO here is another tid-bit of information for you - Yes it does, I myself have verizon, and it indeed works. Also, just for your information, 'Unlocked"" means it will work with any carrier. Also another tid-bit of information, any iphone after the 5s, I mean any iphone after 5s, on any carrier can be taken to any other carrier. For example, lets say I have a Sprint unlimited plan with an iphone 6s Plus, that iPhone 6s Plus can be taken to any other carrier and activated (because its an iphone thats later than the iPhone 5s). Oh and also of course assuming that the phone has been paid in full, because if you do one of those payment plans with the iPhone where they take the cost of the iPhone and divide it by 24 and then add that to your monthly bill, that iPhone cant be taken to any other carrier (even if after 5s) until its been 2 years and been paid on monthly or its paid in full at the time you want to take it to another carrier. Now back to my example, and assuming the iPhone is paid for in full, and lets say I am selling my sprint phone to you (and you have verizon) I would sell the phone to you, and you would then go to sprint yourself, and say i just bought this phone, its been paid in full, and i need you to ""release it from sprint"" so i can take it to my network verizon. And then badda bing your home free, and after that, that iPhone is now ""unlocked"" and can take to your carrier, and then if you were going to sell the phone again down the road, whoever you sell it to would not have to do what you did, because once you did it, the phone became ""unlocked"". So if its an iPhone 5s and later, it is unlocked and can be taken to any carrier no matter what carrier it was used on prior. The days that you had to search for a phone that was on the same network as your own, are gone.",1.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 7, 128GB, Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)"

B01N9YO1DS,Kelly Chamberlain,3,"November 26, 2018",True,Great at first but experienced problems later,"I got this phone back in March after my old one was stolen. It was decently priced and I was desperate. It worked great, looked and felt brand new, I had no problems connecting it with my carrier! After about 6 months, it started to freak out and restart all the time. My apple ID no longer would work so my imessages were turned off, I couldn‚Äôt facetime. It was a nightmare! Also when I would barely put it down on a table the screen would freak out and it was restart again. Sometimes I would have to forse wake it. The people at the Apple Store told me that there was something wrong with the hardware and that many certified refurbished phones have had their hardware touched or messed with during the refurbishing process. I ended up getting a brand new phone about 8 months after I purchased this one. Bottom line, don‚Äôt buy this phone if you want it for a long period of time it will have so many problems in the long run and it‚Äôs more worth it to spend the money on a new phone.",2.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 7, 128GB, Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)"

B01N9YO1DS,Wayne S.,5,"June 5, 2019",True,Going from an iPhone 5s to a refurbished 7 was a pleasant change with this seller!,"Having had no choice since my iPhone 5s died, I had to get a new cell phone. I looked at NEW Verizon plans (ahhh, no thank you) and other providers and decided to stay with Verizon, but get a refurbished phone. The question was now: Android or another iPhone. After reviewing um-teen million reviews, I decided on another (yawn...!) iPhone (shocking!) Now the question was, WHICH iPhone (another yawn). I heard about problems with the 6, the iPhone Pluses were tooo big and the 8s and up were toooo expensive for my needs (hey, it‚Äôs only a PHONE!), so I decided on a....you guessed it, refurbished 7. Well, I am not disappointed. Slightly larger than my 5s, more memory (bunches more!) and in very good condition...NO scratches, gouges, or screen problems. My only complaint is the home button is strange. I like the the old mechanical home button better, it had a better feel, but then, I‚Äôm an old, non-vegan, meat-n-potato‚Äôs, non-gaming, non-craft beer, non-tweeting guy who grew up with rotary phones at home, and pay phones on the road. All in all, I give this phone, and the seller, a 9 out of 10 after a week of use and loading apps and discovering new features. I‚Äôll check back after 6 months and update.

B01N9YO1DS,foyinsi,5,"November 19, 2019",True,Super thorough review ( + comparison to IPhone 6),"Delivery: I ordered this on 11/1 and it was literally delivered by 11/2. Condition Upon Arrival: I inspected the phone after opening and had to look very very closely to see the two little scratches on the back. And I do mean VERY closely. I use a case so it mattered even less. Switching phones: There were no issues taking my TMobile SIM card (have used it for about 2 years now) out of my old phone, putting it in this new one (I used an earring to open the little slot on the side of the phones), and getting this one turned on. It accepted my Sim right away and the setup process began. Setup: It has never been this easy for me to get a new phone set up. After choosing language, entering WiFi password, and putting in Apple ID, it asked me if I wanted to transfer everything from my last iCloud back up. I chose the ‚Äòyes‚Äô option and it said I could just place my old phone next to my new one. Once I unlocked my old phone, I backed it up again (so that it would be as recent as possible). After that was done, I put the two phones (both unlocked) next to each other and the transfer automatically began. Within minutes (maybe 10-15 at most) my new phone had all the apps, pictures/videos, and settings of my old phone. Another point for technology! Comparison to old phone: my last phone was an iPhone 6 (had that exact device for about a year and a half) and honestly, what really prompted the switch was that the touchscreen part of very edge of the right side and bottom were no longer responsive (which was getting really irritating when it came to using my keyboard or accessing options on those parts). This phone (iPhone 7) is the exact same size so I was able to slide it right into the same phone case (which I‚Äôm happy about). It took the first few uses to get used to the feel of the home button but it‚Äôs not as off putting as I thought it‚Äôd be. The camera quality is slightly crisper but I don‚Äôt notice a *huge* difference (no surprise as it‚Äôs only one generation up). The lack of earphone jack hasn‚Äôt been an issue because I use a Bluetooth earpiece (Jabra Talk, to be exact; super old school but I love it because it wraps around my ear and regular earbuds tend to just slip out; plus, I don‚Äôt need to have my phone on me, when I walk around and can go into a whole nother room. Anyway....). It might be an issue later though bc if I‚Äôm in the middle of a call and my earpiece dies, I usually switch to regular earphones. Guess I‚Äôll eventually have to get the piece that lets you connect the two.... Battery life: It doesn‚Äôt take long to charge fully. That said, I can‚Äôt be sure but I think the battery tends to get drained a bit quicker than I‚Äôd expect (though that could just mean that I use it a whole lot throughout the day). Anyway, it hasn‚Äôt been long but overall, the phone is holding up.",,Apple,"Apple iPhone 7, 128GB, Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)"

B01N9YO1DS,Audrey C.,2,"December 12, 2018",True,Severely bummed - had to return. Needs more thorough inspection before resale.,"Bought this phone so I could use it in Korea with a local SIM and because I need to return my primary phone to the manufacturer for a warranty repair for ~30 days and wanted to use it as a backup when I returned to the US. Not sure exactly what the inspection process is as far as ""renewing"" or refurbishing, but the SIM card reader was unable to locate a SIM (tried with several working SIM cards from different carriers & tried the new SIM in other phones without any issues). As if that wasn't disappointing enough, the battery would quickly drain (within ~2-3 hours) *EVEN WHEN THE DEVICE WAS TURNED OFF*. Amazon tech service was unable to sort out the issue and when they put me in touch with Apple, we literally could not get them to pick up the phone for >30 minutes. I'll try another Amazon-supported unlocked iPhone once I get my return credit and I'm hoping the inspection is a bit more thorough this time. I'm also bummed I spent ~$100 in prepaid SIM cards that I have never able to use.",,Apple,"Apple iPhone 7, 128GB, Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)"

Very disappointing, particularly since I bought a renewed phone a couple of years ago that was absolutely spotless. Oh, yeah, for full disclosure, the phone seems to work... UPDATE: after about 1 hour of use, the phone started to heat up near the camera area (and I mean real hot), and a volume control pop-up randomly appeared on the screen with a strong buzz. Looking at settings, a message says: ""your battery health is significantly degraded"". And the vendor promised ""over 80%"". Junk, junk and more junk, asked Amazon to get a refund and return, beware, they are no longer as nice as they used to be, now they want you to deal with the vendor directly.

This can be a real nuisance when having any sort of important phone conversation that I can't place on speakerphone. Additionally, the phone only has 80-some% of its original battery capacity.

I would not trust the seller ""Breed"" nor would I recommend an ""Amazon Renewed"" product- total gamble it looks like to me if you really look through these reviews.

There were greasy fingerprints, gooey crap on the back, and the microphone holes and jack input on the bottom had crusty crap inside, like flakes of skin and nasty mucus. UPDATE: Removed the plastic screen protector to replace with a glass on I purchased separately, and the screen had faint scratches ALL OVER the screen like the phone was rubbed on sand(?!?). Luckily the adhesive for the glass protector filled in the gaps and it looks good. I also noticed a hairline crack of ~2mm from the edge of the home button. So far it hasn't spread, but I can see it being a future problem to be wary of with normal wear and usage. UPDATE: After using the speaker extensively, I noticed the sound quality is worse than an old iPhone 5s. It sounds like a cheap speaker that hasn't been burned in. The sound is loud and the maximum setting projects nicely but the sound quality is sub-par for this generation iPhone. Did not come with manufacturer made cable and charging plug(Apple). It was some random generic off-brand, but the listing did say they may be. Although the description portion says it won‚Äôt work with Verizon or Sprint, it has so far (~1day). The features and details contradicts the Description and says those two carrier do work as well. UPDATE: Still working on-network taking calls, voice mail, texts, and iMessage (~4days). Phone got EXTREMELY HOT when downloading data to the point of burning skin if held too long. UPDATE: Phone still gets hot downloading small MB downloads. Battery was NOT ‚Äúat least 80% capacity‚Äù in settings and had a message to service the battery. Will be testing battery life extensively. UPDATE: (~4 days) Battery lasts fairly well with extensive screen, location, and bluetooth usage. Even streaming is fairly light on battery usage.

The box it was in was a generic box, not an apple box, which is as per description. When I opened it, the phone was wrapped in bubble wrap and looked flawless - no blemishes as all. I purchased this for my wife who had an iPhone 5. I took the sim-card out of the iPhone 5 and put it in this 6S and it was up and running - every bit as easy as that. Putting the sim card into it connected it to our Verizon wireless account and she was able to use all features - phone, text, and email (after the email was set up.) The sim-card DID NOT transfer any data files like pictures, notes, etc. We had to transfer those ourselves. After we had the phone for perhaps 3 or 4 weeks, it stopped working - not texts and no calls. I called Verizon, and I don't know what they did, but it was very soon fully operational again so that problem obviously was NOT the phone. Pros: As far as I'm concerned this phone is a total positive with one tiny exception and that is that the battery health as registered on the phone is about 87%. I consider this to be very acceptable for a refurbished phone. Cons: Except for the slight battery degradation, - NONE.

The trick is to get a brand new SIM card (from a retail location or shipped) and have the customer service activate the SIM and transfer your number to the new card. Sprint SIM cards are locked to both the IMEI and ICCID (IMEI must match ICCID in Sprint's system). The ""refurbished"" part of this is where it gets tricky. It seems like the device I received was originally a rose gold device that had it's internals swapped to a new phone. iTunes recognizes it as a rose gold and so does Sprint through the IMEI. The screen has slight ghosting, but it is hard to notice unless you are looking hard.

Based on how the screen brightness changed quite a bit when viewed under a pair of rotating polarized sunglasses, the screen could well be non-OEM. The big issue, however, is the battery, whose max capacity is only at 79% of the original. Per Apple, this battery is used up and needs to be replaced.

B06XR8G1TX,Albert Rodriguez,1,"August 5, 2018",True,Mine came with a few issues. From Kiss Electronics Inc,My phone came a few issues but I do realize that this might have just been a bad one that I received. 1. The phone is pretty beat up all the way around the edges. Not a big deal to me as I assume this is a used phone and a case covers it anyways. 2. The battery is completely shot. The percentage will drop more than 50% within an hour of just browsing the internet. This will cause me to need to pay $30 to get it replaced. 3. It also seems to have trouble charging when connected to a car. I have to restart the phone for it to start charging properly. 4. The speaker is pretty busted as well. When playing sound or talking on the speaker you can hear a lot of static. 5. The touch screen seems a little wonky. These issues have been frustrating and I will probably return the phone soon and order another one. Hopefully one without so many issues.,4.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 6S, 64GB, Space Gray - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)"
B06XR8G1TX,marc archambeau,1,"January 13, 2019",True,Refurbished shouldn't mean really used,"The phone mechanics are in very good order. The battery seems fine as does the OS. The charging port is still tight and the buttons click effectively like ON/OFF and Volume. However the screen is well used. In my experience with refurbs they always replace the screen. This one has wear. Sort of like buying a really mechanically sound used car whose paint is melted off and the seller ignored it. It is a 64gb phone so its an ok deal. A screen that didn't suck would make it four or five stars. Really odd because the camera lens appears to be new and if you opened it for that why not replace the glass. Used an otter box with a wireless charger. The ballistic otter box and wireless charger go well together and the phone charges fine. Also , these refurb places only give you ninety days.....I HIGHLY recommend the added protection. Amazon sells a pretty much no hassle added protection plan and since the seller isn't more confident in their work, GET IT.",2.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 6S, 64GB, Space Gray - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)"

Because it was a certified factory refurbished 6S, it certainly appeared to be brand spanking new in every way. After two months of use, I have had no problems whatsoever with it. That said, and as a long time android user, I still can't understand why Apple still hasn't decided to put the period, comma and numbers on the same page with all the lower case letters when texting. When I asked my son if that wasn't an inconvenience to him, his reply was, ""Well, I've always owned Apple phones and always took it for granted that to punctuate or enter numbers, you have to go to another screen to select them."" So, for all the Apple users out there, It's a great phone for the money, and if you're an android user, you've got some re-learning to do.",3.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 6S, 64GB, Space Gray - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)"

B06XR8G1TX,Tec,4,"March 30, 2019",True,Mixed Reviews but I think it about who you purchase from.,"The phone was as I expected. Came in a generic box with charger and cable. It was also unlocked. Because of other reviews, I thought I would put it through its paces before I commit to transferring to this phone. WiFi and Bluetooth were the first test and did great. I updated the OS and then transferred my old phone content over to the new phone. Everything transferred without an issue. I then updated all the apps and that also went as expected. The final step was to add this phone to my Xfinity Mobile account and transfer my T-Mobile pay as you go number over to this phone. It all went fine, after giving the operator the IMEI number from the phone, and the information to transfer my number over. After about 15 minutes the service was moved over to my new phone. I had some concerns after reading other mixed reviews. But I think the other reviews are correct. It may be about whom you purchase it from. I purchased from BuySPRY. The only thing I was not able to test at this point is the battery life but I expect it to be good as well.

Nightingale,5,"June 13, 2019",True,Looks Brand New!,"We have sort of adopted my 17 yr old daughter's boyfriend, so when the iphone 6s that he was using (which was a hand me down from my daughter) died after having a soda spilled on it, I came to Amazon to try to find a replacement. With mixed reviews, it's hard to know who to trust, but when I found one through Amazon Renewed, I jumped on it.

I proudly showed off my obsolete phone to my students who enjoyed teasing me about it. I finally took the plunge (upgrading from 8 year old technology to 4 year old technology - not the biggest plunge I suppose). Had to get a new SIM card since the old phone had a micro and the 6s needed a nano (don't even try to cut a micro down). This phone is incredible, finally allowing me to graduate from 3G and take advantage of things like WiFi assisted calling, bigger screen, apps that I can actually use, etc. And, as of now anyway, is still ""modern"" in that it is supported by the latest iOS release. This particular ""renewed"" phone arrived on time in excellent condition, had no blemishes or scratches that I could see, and has a battery life of 91%. **Very** happy with this purchase.",,Apple,"Apple iPhone 6S, 64GB, Space Gray - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)"

B06XRG6S73,smm5743,5,"April 6, 2017",True,Amazing deal,"As I'm sure a lot of you know, it's difficult to find a reasonably priced CDMA unlocked iPhone. I was looking for one to use with Straight Talk on their Verizon network, but most iPhone 6 or greater cost around 450. I was incredibly skeptical of this, but gave it a shot. It's only my first day, so I know things can always go wrong, but so far it's working well. Came with the phone and charging cable. The box it came in looked a little rough, but the phone was fine. I only noticed 2 very small cosmetic flaws and they don't bother me in the slightest. The screen is completely free of imperfection. Setting up the phone with Straight Talk was a little tricky, but that had nothing to do with the phone, in my opinion. In case anyone else is planning to the do the same, here's how it went for me. I did the BYOP activation kit and am using a new number - I did not port an existing number. I slipped in the ""Verizon"" sim that came with the kit and tried to activate it online. It told me the phone wasn't compatible and I was disappointed. I called customer service and we were able to get it up and running, despite the representative also being unsure that it would work. I did have to update to the latest software before really using the phone. That was the most time-consuming part. Can't complain yet, especially for the price! I know it isn't ""new"" but the difference can hardly be seen.",46.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 6S, 16GB, Rose Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)"

Took it to Verizon for a sim card and found out the sim card tray was bent. The technician was able to get the sim card in, but with some difficulty. The battery in this phone is useless. It only stays charged for about an hour. Electronic Deals sent us a new sim card tray and said they would reimburse us up to $20 toward a new battery. It is a major inconvenience to try and find an Apple Store where we can go get this taken care of. They aren't exactly located all over - the closest one to us is an hour and a half drive away. Ordering one of these phone is taking a chance and hoping that maybe the one you order will be decent - but very likely not. I think Amazon should require that these phones be in better condition before being sold. The response I got back from Electronic Deals was that I could return the phone if I'm not happy, but that isn't the easiest thing to do once you have activated it with your carrier and then don't have another phone to use in the meantime.

Never heard of any problems with it or no request to return so I'm assuming it's performing as expected. Price was competitive and actually a bit better than walmart.com with prime shipping. I'm trying to be objective because I don't care for Apple products. No memory expansion is one big reason but also customer support. But it's a nice phone with ease of use high.

Battery life seems pretty good so far (using for about a week but I am not on it constantly like some people). Battery health (Beta) on the phone in settings says it's 88% max capacity (although it does charge to 100%). I ordered 16GB but you forget that the operating system takes up almost all of the available space which stinks (apple needs to fix that). Gave it 4 stars because it did not come with an apple charger/cord and it took longer to charge with the crappy ones they sent compared to when I connected it to a real apple charger that I have for my work phone.

We took it to the apple store where we learned we were basically screwed. A Certified Apple Refurbish would have been under warranty. But if you buy a phone here, you have 60 days for the problems to show up or you will be screwed too. Certified, but by who? Guaranteed? Not really. In speaking to Apple, they are NOT condoning sales of these types, they do NOT support outside party certifications, and rightfully so, as this is how you ruin a reputation. Putting terrible product out on the market that no one can do anything about.

The touch ID sometimes is not responsive and sometimes I have a hard time actually engaging the dictation button. I‚Äôll tap directly on it and it won‚Äôt register me touching it but it will register the emoji key and the space key right next to it. I‚Äôve also run into issues with the battery. The phone will randomly shut itself off around say 10%. It doesn‚Äôt do it every time, it‚Äôs completely at random. When I try to power it back on and it will show the empty battery with the power plug and red bar at the end of the battery saying that the battery is dead. However, when I go to plug my phone back into a charger and power it up, it will say that it is actually at say 40%. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm too thrilled about spending $80 to have the battery replaced. Amazing phone for a great price! It arrived quickly and has no blemishes on it whatsoever. When it did come in, it was dead so I had to plug it in but within 5 minutes or so, it was up to 4% and I was able to power it on. I was moving from Android back to iPhone and try to use the Move to IOS app but it didn't work out too well. I doubt that is an issue with the phone though. The battery lasts several hours with heavy use and when it gets low, it charges back up very quickly. The network I use is Straight Talk which uses Verizon's towers and I was able to get it set up very quickly. It does not come with a SIM card so you will have to buy one for your provider. However, it does come with a SIM card tool which is like a little pin to eject the SIM card slot. If for some reason it doesn't come with the tool, you can easily use a push pin just keep in mind the SIM card slot comes out all the way. It does have a sticker on the back with the serial number and the IMEI number which doesn't come off cleanly. I used Goo Gone to remove the residue and it cleaned it up nicely.

There was a lot of scrapes and dents along the edge of the phone; the previous owner clearly didn't use a case. All of the ports; headphone jack, charger, sim card, silent button, they all had a large build up of dirt in them. I had to carefully use a paper clip and some brushes to clean out all of the grime.. which I wasn't expecting, based on all of the positive reviews. The cleaning certainly lacked any attention to detail and the even the protective film was thrown on quite quickly, it overlapped at the edges and there was air bubbles all over. It would only take a few extra minutes to carefully clean the phone and apply the protective film correctly.",2.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 6S, 64GB, Rose Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)"

Another plus of my purchase was that the phone came with a pre-installed tempered glass screen protector, as well as a charging cord, and the charging block itself. The jet black color is in amazing condition for this phone being refurbished.",19.0,Apple,Apple iPhone 7 Plus 256GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Smartphone - Jet Black (Renewed)
B06XS3CTJM,Amazon Customer,3,"April 6, 2019",True,Only one small flaw.. otherwise very nice phone,"Really pleasantly surprised. Phone looked pretty much brand new. Everything so far working great.. the battery life shows 93 percent or new. Edit: when I got the phone I was pleasantly surprised that it came with a glass screen protector.. after using awhile I noticed a weird small line in the middle of the screen which I examined closely and appeared to be due to the protector being damaged... unfortunately it was not the protector, there is a small line of dead pixels on the screen itself. In fairness I didn‚Äôt contact the seller as I didn‚Äôt know how big of a hassle it would be to swap out and for me to get all my personal info off of this phone. Kinda sucks because I notice it all the time now and I never have dropped this phone or anything since owning.

B06XS3CTJM,Kathleen Numerich,1,"December 17, 2019",True,NOT UNLOCKED,"I bought this for my daughter for Xmas. I read A LOT of Q&A's to make sure that whatever I chose, it was in as best condition that I could find and unlocked so that she would be able to connect to her service. Everything I went through on this phone was exactly what I was looking for; however, she has not been able to connect it to her service because it keeps saying it is locked by verizon. She was told by verizon and apple that the phone is unlocked but when she puts in her sim card, it doesn't work. Apple tried to work with her to unlock it but was still unable to unlock. Now it seems we have to either look for a phone kit to hopefully fix the issue or return it so she can get something else. This is infuriating when we spent over $300 and now either possibly more or she has to go without a phone with a one year old at home so we can return it. I haven't been able to find how to contact them. Hopefully someone sees this and helps me fix it or I'm going to air mail it back to their office and not care where it lands.",,Apple,Apple iPhone 7 Plus 256GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Smartphone - Jet Black (Renewed)

There‚Äôs some sort of issue effecting the screen (and everything is bouncing- see video). It‚Äôs also effecting typing things in- for example the unlock screen types in wrong numbers for password and we now are locked out of the phone. This has happened 4 times- you go to type in the first number and it inputs more than you type and then locks phone. We‚Äôve been locked out several times now. Definitely a screen issue. UPDATE: amazon and seller weer both extremely responsive. It was backed by an amazon guarantee, but seller responded immediately and allowed us to return and we got a full refund. I elected not to have another resent- We were aware it‚Äôs a refurbished product so another *might* have been ok, but we decided against trying again at this price. Customer service was excellent though- so very happy about that and added an additional star.

The phone was in great condition, the only thing I noticed were a few slight dings where it may a fallen with the previous owner but it‚Äôs nothing serious or too compromising (knowing it‚Äôs a pre-owned device). I purchased my screen protector and case separate but I was curious if it came with a screen protector since most of the pictures here has it on, so I just thought it may be good to know. Finally I don‚Äôt wanna make this too long but I noticed that most of the bad reviews here are due to peoples sim cards not working, and that‚Äôs easy to figure out why with just a little research. It says in the title that the device is GSM unlocked which means it only worked with AT&T, T-Mobile and some others I think, but not Sprint and Verizon.

Every model after the 7 has a ‚Äúduel antenna‚Äù making compatability easier. So, I don‚Äôt know if this is just a manufacturing issue by Apples part or a bad device from the retailers part, otherwise I‚Äôd give five stars.

The Plus models have an additional camera which allows for portrait mode - which is awesome! Great pictures. Obviously the phone is larger than the non-Plus models but I got used to that within a few days. One strange issue I had that you might have too is that the phone might be sourced from a non-American batch. Specifically, it might be sourced from Japan - a country in which local law mandates that taking a picture must always be accompanied by the shutter sound and cannot be turned off. Weird, right? I can get around it a bit by taking ""live"" pictures, which minimizes the sound for some reason. But any picture taken through an app like Snapchat or portrait mode will have that loud shutter sound. I considered returning the phone but ultimately decided that the annoying shutter sound was worth putting up with because buying this phone on Amazon vs Apple Store saved me roughly $350 - quite significant!",,Apple,"Apple iPhone 7 Plus, AT&T Locked, 128GB - Jet Black (Renewed)"

B0731HBTZ7,Matthew,1,"October 27, 2019",True,"Buyer beware, purchase another model or buy elsewhere!","Where should I begin? Well, let's start off with something positive, this iPhone 7 is a solid offering (on paper) at the current price point. In theory, if the device delivered is in the condition listed on the product page, how can you go wrong for about $200? I hate to break it to you, but this can go VERY WRONG in a relatively short amount of time. I'm currently on my second renewed iPhone 7. The first one I only had for about a month and then the screen decided to separate from the metal casing of the iPhone, so I logged into my Amazon account and processed a warranty replacement. The warranty replacement showed up in two days time, no complaints there. I'm currently on my 2nd device from the original purchase and then I start getting battery life notices popping up on screen, and then a few weeks later, the center of my phone display starts to form a slight curve and gets more pronounced as the week progresses. I take my iPhone to the Genius Bar at their retail store and come to find out the battery in my iPhone has failed and is starting to bulge and expand while still in the phone. Normally I would log into my Amazon account or contact customer service and see what options are available, but of course, my warranty expired six days ago as of this review, so officially I have no warranty coverage. When I did try to contact customer service, I talked to four different reps over the course of about an hour on the phone and finally the two options provided to me to resolve this issue was...#1: ""Contact Apple and see if they will honor their warranty"", small problem with this is that there is only a 1 year limited warranty on iPhone's and the one year warranty started when the first owner had this phone. The phone is about two years old at this point I would assume, but definitely NOT covered under any warranty by the manufacturer. But their retail stores are more than happy to take my money and repair it. Option #2: ""We can make an exception and you can send the phone back in. Even though you have a damaged battery, UPS will still take the package. We even have a warning label we can provide you that you can put on the box."" Normally I would be more than happy to go with this option, however, the local UPS store has made it abundantly clear, they will not accept a package with a damaged or potentially damaged lithium ion battery due to the fire risk. The only way the phone could be safely shipped is with a fire resistant packaging which I don't have and the local UPS Store also does not have. Bottom line, I'm stuck with a phone that has a failing battery and glitchy phone display because of the swelling battery AND I'm also out of the money I paid for this iPhone, and I don't have a properly working phone. I would suggest the following, purchase a pre-owned iPhone elsewhere or just go with another phone all together, don't bother purchasing an Amazon Renewed device, the quality and reliability just isn't there.",2.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 7 32GB, Rose Gold (Renewed)"

Did lots of researching online, called Apple, who said it was probably a bad SIM card. Suddenly, an hour later, the phone started connecting to the cell tower. Great! I thought. It worked just fine for a few hours, and the phone showed ""No service"" again. I tried factory reset, connecting to Apple Store through my laptop, lots & lots of time troubleshooting. After a Google search, I discovered that iPhone 7 A1660 models had a problem antenna, which Apple was fixing for free when the phones were first manufactured (up to 3 years). I tried ""chatting"" online with an Apple service rep, who could not tell me if Apple would service the phone, or if I needed to return it to the Amazon seller. I finally decided to just return it.

B0731HBTZ7,Kindle Customer,1,"August 4, 2018",True,DONT BUY. READ THE REVIEWS!,"To start out when the phone came the screen was popped out slightly in the top left corner. I thought no big deal it's a refurbished phone. The first week it worked great, everything functioned as it should but then around day 10 it started overheating quickly. The next few days it would die a lot faster than it had even when I put it on low power mode. After that I noticed the screen was popped out more, almost like all the overheating was making some glue or seal for the screen melt so it separated. The final straw was when it would be at about 70-50% battery then just suddenly turn off and die, when I tried turning it on it showed the screen suggesting you plug it in, so I did. Then it would turn on the second I plugged it in and show 1%, then change straight to 10%, then 20-30% and I would take it off the charger and it would die right away again. It did that for 3 days before I decided to return it. I didn't even have it a month.

I have an iPhone 7 and recently it has been saying ""No Service"" or ""Searching"" where the LTE signal usually is. It didn't bother me at first because I am not on my phone all day. However, I started receiving text messages that were sent over 3 weeks ago. My calls constantly fail or just don't work at all. I will be in the middle of using my GPS to get somewhere and it will just quit working. I originally thought this was a Verizon problem so I took it to them. Turns out, my iPhone 7 has this happen regularly with many customers so I was instructed to take it to the Apple Store. I did this and they basically told me that they couldn't do anything until it gets worse because it doesn't ""qualify for the program"" to replace it yet. I run a business and need a reliable phone that can consistently get text messages and calls. This has already hurt my business because clients think I am ignoring them. Apple refuses to fix it. Do not purchase this phone or any Apple phone for that matter because I am sure the news ones will start to have the same issues.

B0731HBTZ7,Francisco Gonz√°lez,1,"December 4, 2019",True,Esta compra para mi fue una Estafa,Resulta que compre el tel√©fono para regal√°rselo a mi hija de Navidad . Cuando llegue al pa√≠s donde reside mi hija y le fui a poner el chip me dijeron que el tel√©fono est√° BLOQUEADO. ( en el anuncuio de este vendedor dice desbloqueado) y cuando voy para que me lo desbloquee un profesional me dice que me ESTAFARON porque este tel√©fono est√° bloqueado por la operadora(p√©guese ser que tenga deuda pendiente) y la respuesta de este vendedor es que ya pasaron 90 d√≠as TENGAN MUCHO CUIDADO CON ESTE VENDEDOR QUIZ√ÅS NO DURE MUCHO EN AMAZON. Lamentablemente y responsablemente les digo que para mi cuando algo no coincide con lo descrito y de las caracteristicas que he relatado me siento ESTAFADO POR ESTE VENDEDOR Y SIN UNA RESPUESTA DECENTE . Es una l√°stima que me haya pasado a mi pero lo digo para que no le pase a ud quien me lo iba a desbloquear me dijo que seguramente es de esos tel√©fonos que compran a operadores con planes y despu√©s NO PAGAN el plan y por eso la operadora no lo va a desbloquear. Parece INCRE√çBLE QUE ESTE TIPO DE SITUACIONESTIDAVIA PASEN Y AMAZON ME RESPINDIO QUE COMO PASO MAS DE UN MESELLOS TAMPOCO SE HACEN RESPONSABLES.

B0731HBTZ7,Martin,4,"September 16, 2019",True,Works very well.,"Had to ask for exchange because the first they sent didn‚Äôt work with verizon. The one they sent as replacement had a really nice screen, with not visible scratches. The back of the phone, however, had a discoloration around the area of the camera; the part that case would leave open. The ring around the camera also had three minor, but visible, dents, but that‚Äôs pretty much all aesthetic complaints. Internally, it works well, except that there is the mental barrier where I keep thinking someone else used this phone. That said, they have a very wonderful customer service that they even provide their phone number for quick fixes over the phone.",,Apple,"Apple iPhone 7 32GB, Rose Gold (Renewed)"
B0731HBTZ7,Michael T,2,"May 19, 2019",True,Dropped and screen went out a month after we got it,"Outer condition is very good, we have a good case on it with a screen protector. Screen protector cracked and the screen underneath was fine. A couple hours later the screen stopped working. Paid to have the screen replaced and it is now fine. The thing I find with the rebuilds is they aren't as robust as the new units. Some are better than others. It wasn't the end of the world, screen replacement is common. Just don't expect new performance of longevity. I bought a replacement for a rebuild, it ended up having a factory known issue. Apple said they would fix it until they looked and found non apple components in the phone.

So 3.5 months (just outside the 90 day warranty!!!!) after spending $215 on this phone, it stops functioning. There is a glitch on the logic board that makes it not possible to get service, no matter your carrier settings. I contacted the seller about the issue and of course they referred me to their strict ‚Äú90 day warranty‚Äù and there is no possibility for return or exchange.

The case however has several scratches, small dents and scratches...most could overlook the condition, but it‚Äôs prettt close to sub-par. The biggest issue I had with the shipment was that the phone was physically dirty (maybe fecal matter) and I had to thoroughly clean the device before I felt it was safe to be handled....easily something that should have been done by the reseller. The other issue is that it looks like the screen was removed or replaced and improperly installed, resulting in the phone being 1mm thicker at the top vs the bottom, may be a non issue but most cases won‚Äôt fit now and there is a potential fire hazard since the battery may have been improperly tampered with.",8.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone SE, 32GB, Gold - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)"

B07753NSQZ,Les H,5,"March 28, 2019",True,A great phone from a great seller!,"I researched the iPhone 6,7, and 8 as replacements for my aging 5s. I also sought out sellers with good ratings for this purchase. I settled on MyWit based on their reviews and their volume of sales. The phone arrived a day early and it is absolutely pristine. If it is a refurb, there are zero signs of that as there are no marks anywhere on it. Not even finger prints or dust. It came with a nice flex lighting cable and Apple charger (no sim as advertised). I put the sim card from my old iPhone 5s in it and went through the setup questions. I had a fully functional iPhone 8 in 5 minutes tops. I selected the iPhone 8 over the 6 or 7 due to the advanced technology in the 8. It is worth the extra $100 over the same size 7. It is fast but the battery lasts all day without showing significant signs of needing a charge. I also purchased a Speck Candy Shell case for this phone. The iPhone 8 has a glass back for wireless charging and it is very smooth and slick to hold. With my dry fingers, it is difficult to even use the phone so a case is necessary to give it some grip. The Speck case is a perfect, anti-slip and lots of drop and screen protection. See this case here https://www.amazon.com/Speck-Products-CandyShell-Phone-iPhone/dp/B01K094IZ8 Very pleased with the seller too and I would certainly use them for another phone purchase without question!",109.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone 8, GSM Unlocked, 256GB - Space Gray (Renewed)"

B07753NSQZ,RxH,5,"September 26, 2019",True,iPhone 8 256GB Space Gray Unlocked GSM,"iPhone 8 256GB Space Gray Unlocked GSM What came in the box 1. iPhone 8 256GB Space Gray Unlocked GSM 2. Lightning Cable 3. USB Plug 4. Original Box What was not in the box 1. Earphones 2. SIM Card Removal Tool 3. User Manual The cable and plug are white and wrapped in plastic just like what you would get if it was new from Apple. I cannot tell if these are originals. Earphones Have always used 3rd party so not getting a set was not a deal breaker. Phone Condition Body is in very good condition. There are paint flecks on the corners, maybe dropped on a hardwood floor, it is smooth to the touch, not deep so it does not appear to have been dropped on concrete, pavement or other rough surface and it is not a light scratch from carrying it in a pocket. Screen Condition It came with a screen protector already applied. If there are any scratches I cannot tell. With the protector on, it looks pristine. A bummer since it was not mentioned in the ad and I had purchased a case and screen protector for it. I always protect the phone before it goes outside. It‚Äôs an expensive device so why people don‚Äôt protect it from day one I‚Äôll never know, I guess some don‚Äôt care. I have a spare screen protector now. Battery Condition ‚Ä®Battery Health says 91% Maximum Capacity relative to when it was new, 86% charge on startup. Even though capacity says 91%, I am not having issues where I am out of juice early. Over a day with moderate use, heavier use I would need to recharge around 06:00pm-07:00 pm. This of course is a YMMV. Setting it up Phone was already reset. You set it up just like if it came straight out of the factory. Camera No scratches on the lens and photos come out crisp and sharp. Speakers No issues, sound is very good. No hissing, cracks or pops. Microphone, Lighting Port No issues. Works. Phone came with iOS 12.3.1 installed. So far I have not come across any issues that would give me pause on the purchase. Phone is working as expected and the ad says phone is like new and I would have to agree. ‚Ä®Amazon tends to lump all the reviews together, regardless of seller so you can‚Äôt tell which negative review belongs to who. It‚Äôs as if it was all sold by one seller. Reviewers need to say who their seller was. My seller was MobileDealz and at the time they were a little bit cheaper than most. ‚Ä® This phone debut at 849.00 + tax on September 22, 2017. Nearly 2 years later it is has seen a 50%+ price drop.

Like new, camera worked great, absolutely no issues. However, my phone got stolen from me at the end of October. So I ordered a second one- complete opposite experience. Came in a small, dirty box with some weird charger. Had obvious scratches on the screen, and the pictures taken with the camera was noticeably worse quality. I had been waiting for 3 weeks to replace my phone so I gave it a shot anyway... the microphone did not work at all. When people called, I could hear them and they couldn't hear me- which I had this misfortune of finding out while needing roadside service from AAA, who hung up on me upon my ""lack"" of response when I answered the phone. Took it to T Mobile and chatted online with Apple to do some troubleshooting- turns out it's just a bad refurbished phone, so the only answer was to return it. Disappointed overall- good luck with your order... 12/2/2019 Increasing my review from 2 stars to 3 stars. Still leaving off one star for the 1 busted up phone, and 1 star for the inconvenience and 3 weeks of waiting to replace my phone- as well as both times the shipping delayed, (however only by 1 day each time, but I think I should mention it since it is listed ""Prime FREE Delivery""). I ordered a third phone with my fingers crossed and as a last attempt to try out this phone. THANK GOODNESS IT PAID OFF. I got another phone, quality as good as the first one. I leave this review after 1.5 weeks of phone 3 with no issues. I will update my review if anything changes but currently I am relieved it worked out.",,Apple,"Apple iPhone 8, GSM Unlocked, 256GB - Space Gray (Renewed)"

I read several reviews that mentioned that you can‚Äôt turn the camera click off - no problem here. And there was no issue getting it set up with our service provider (Sprint). When considering buying this phone based on reviews, consider a few things: this is hundreds of dollars cheaper than buying one new, Amazon‚Äôs return service is impeccable so if worst comes to worst, just return it and get another one, and also consider the fact that on average only roughly 10% of people even bother writing Amazon reviews and that a majority of the people leaving 1 star reviews probably wouldn‚Äôt have written a review at all if everything checked out like this phone did (I almost forgot to write a review myself).

The charger that was included worked great. However, I think this phone must be from Korea or Japan, where it's apparently illegal to take digital photos without an audible shutter click. There is absolutely no way to turn off the sound, even when the phone is muted and the volume is turned all the way down. It happens in every major application that uses the camera. As an art student, I take TONS of pictures, and the camera is the primary reason why I got the iPhone X. I took it to multiple IT stores where they told me to either return the phone or to jailbreak it to rewrite the lines of code that affect the feature (and jailbreaking voids any warranty or service that Apple offers). I'm returning it because it's too big of a hiccup to work around (can't take pictures in a wedding/library/quiet setting at all...!). Ideally, they should make sure that the country of origin is taken into consideration before selling someone a product if it's going to be such a major feature difference.

B0775451TT,Chad Bambrick,1,"September 19, 2019",True,Not as they claim,"This item is claimed to be a ""functioning like new"" device, but this is NOT TRUE AT ALL. Let me walk through this dramatic tragedy in detail. I had been monitoring the package from the moment after purchase, so it wasn't an accident that on that bright, sunny day I was waiting by the mailbox as the delivery truck cruised in. Grabbing my package, I ran inside, ecstatic at the prospect of my newest gadget. Gazing at that chrome-plated beauty, I knew love at first sight was true. As I set up this electronic treasure, I tap into ""settings"" to feast my eyes on the sight you rarely see in an iPhone... the battery at full capacity reader proudly gleaming a 100% like-new condition. But no, what sight met my eyes gave me a horror as you would not believe. Eighty....... Three...... Percent...... Now my mind was racing. I had already vowed til death do us part, but now looking at my bride's screen I realized what I had to do. I needed a second doctors opinion. I scheduled an appointment as soon as we returned from the honeymoon with Apple Memorial Hospital, and settled in to an uneasy vacation with my new love.... it was then that tragedy struck. As I started editing a slow motion video of a man breaking an egg on his forehead, the screen flickered and died. I gently tried to shake her awake, hitting the power and volume button up and down (Mainly down. A volume button being obviously a huge plus on a wife) As I rushed her to the ER at the nearest Apple Memorial Hospital I feared the worst. And the worst is what I got. Her heart, (known as a smart board) had failed. She would never speak to me again. I never saw her eyes open since that day, and I'll never forget the last image I saw of her, as the egg was making it's final impact on that man's head. I don't tell this story for self pity. I realize that this may be emotional for many of you to recall similar moments in your life's past. Perhaps even recent past. I share this only from a place of love and concern for other members of this community in the Amazon, that you don't make the same mistakes as I did. I will add one last word and say I have found support groups especially helpful during this emotional time. Thank you all for your time, and I hope you never buy.. *ahem, marry* a bride from this father-in-law. Happy phone hunting!",4.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone X, 256GB, Silver - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)"

Only problem is my phone was made for the Japanese/Chinese market and my camera shutter sound won‚Äôt turn off. Other than that... Battery is great, face ID is amazing, but after reading a lot of the reviews I‚Äôd say that I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying from this seller. They are difficult to contact and if you have any problems they seem to turn you away and blame the buyer. Yes, it‚Äôs a good deal considering this phone was originally sold at $1000, but i‚Äôve read reviews that the phone was locked because of the difference in country, it was originally stolen or the phone plan hasn‚Äôt been entirely paid off. Also, their ‚Äúrefurbishments‚Äù aren‚Äôt really refurbishments. Again, I feel like I got extremely lucky with my phone. There‚Äôs only one problem that really isn‚Äôt that big of a problem. But please, if you really want a good quality phone for around this price, check with your carrier and see if they have some discounted phones or refurbished phones that are actually refurbished.

Camera lens seems unstable and rattles sometimes taking blurry pictures and video. I tried to submit a warranty request for their 90 day warranty but they wanted me to return the phone and be without one for more than a week and go through another 10hrs of wiping data and reloading data/signing in and setting up apps. I was also out of the country and couldn‚Äôt do that. Anyway they still get one extra star for providing decent service and having an ok product. After I fix these things though could have just bought a new one. So think about that first. You might get lucky. You might not My initial review (3 stars): Generally this phone is in pretty good shape. Battery life is at 89%, the case is nice, and the photo lens is clear.

I have held off on writing a review in hopes that this phone would improve but it continues to be crap. My first issue with this phone is it's lack of a headphone jack. Now when I purchased this phone I knew I would have to carry around an adapter and I was willing to accept that; however, I was not prepared for my phone to not play music or connect even when I had said adapter. Furthermore, it used to not continuously charge meaning I would constantly have to re-plug it in and now it refuses to charge all together. Also, it will stop playing songs or Siri will turn on (even after I disabled her) for no reason. In addition, the camera will constantly freeze when I try to zoom in which has often stopped me from taking amazing photos. All in all this phone is glitchy, not worth the money, ugly (I mean did they really think making the top dip down was a good idea?), and will ultimately annoy you to the point where you have to write a rant online and not even on the official website because apple doesn't want to hear people's opinions.",28.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone X, 256GB, Silver - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)"

Here's why the iPhone X, for all its power and beauty, really just deserves a ""B"" for its design: 1) The phone's signature looks turn anonymous inside a case. 2) The phone's surfaces all scratch easily. 3) It is the most slippery phone I've ever encountered. Add these things together, and you have a beautiful phone that MUST be put in an obscuring case, which makes its beauty kind of pointless. Inside a case and switched off, it doesn't even have Apple's signature circular button to identify itself. As of right now, I only have glass protectors on the front and back, but I know what will happen if I keep it like this long-term. The other new feature on the iPhone X is Face ID, or ""expensive way to avoid having a button on the front of the phone."" It works fine, but requires mild adjustments in how you use your phone and is definitely no better than Touch ID. I turned off the ""attention detection,"" meaning I don't have to be looking directly at the phone to unlock it, and now it is quick and unobtrusive. Finally, there's the ""notch."" This is a non-issue. I don't know what the fuss is about unless you're a software designer. Moving on. All in all, I've had my iPhone X for a couple months and couldn't be happier. It is not perfect, and I'll bet it'll be completely replaced by Fall 2019 (now that designer Jonny Ive is back in charge), but I'm loving everything about it.

It‚Äôs not terrible, but I would consider it a little more severe than minimal. Battery health was said to be about 80% if I remember correctly.

I was unimpressed with any enhanced features, and namely the new face recognition to unlock the device. After the first two days of owning the new iPhone, I was over it. Gone was the ease of simply using a finger print to unlock the phone. This became annoying since I have to have a passcode on the phone and many apps I use day to day require either a pin or passcode which would generally use the finger id. Yes, the face recognition would unlock the device, but I had to literally pickup the phone every time I wanted to access email, text messages, or review information in an app. Previously, my phone could rest on my desk, I simply use my finger id to unlock and easily access whatever. Now, I have to pick up the phone or make it obvious I am accessing something on my phone. Aside from the new facial recognition, there is nothing really feature enhanced from the iPhone 7. Sure, you can argue, better camera etc, but that is minimal and not worth the money or upgrade with something already awesome.

B0775H5HJW,Kelly,4,"November 21, 2019",True,iPhone X 256gb (Silver),"I was very nervous about buying a refurbished phone, but everyone in my 5 person family all needed a new phone at the same time. I knew that would be costly since we use Straight Talk and would have to buy unlocked phones at full cost up front. I am writing this review for all three phones I purchased from this seller, but I will only attach photos of the specific phone the review is attached to. 2 - iPhone X 1 - iPhone Xs Max All refurbished. The phones came well packaged in ""Certified Refurbished"" boxes. All phones are GSM or Fully Unlocked and all work with Straight Talk service. I was able to just transfer the SIM card they were already using to the new phones without service interruption. ***iPhone X 256gb (Silver): The back is flawless. The screen has VERY minor blemishes that appear to have been caused by over buffing/polishing the glass. Nowhere near bad enough to send the phone back. I mean... I got an iPhone X 256gb for $500. I seriously can't complain about that. We decided to go on and give the kids their phones (Christmas gifts) early just to make sure they were fully functional. This phone works like new and is a HUGE upgrade from my 12 year olds Samsung Galaxy S4 which was a hand-me-down to make sure she was responsible enough for a phone. To say she is ecstatic is an understatement. This phone gets an A- for the scratches on the screen and the fact that it was missing the sim card key. (Btw, the Silver looks more like white.) iPhone X 256gb (Space Gray): The screen is flawless. The back has extremely minor wear and tear scratches. Nothing a case won't cover up. We decided to go on and give the kids their phones (Christmas gifts) early just to make sure they were fully functional. This phone works like new and is an upgrade from my 16 year olds Samsung Galaxy S7 which was a hand-me-down because he broke his old iPhone 5 (Don't let your kid put their phone in their backpack with heavy textbooks!). He is so happy to have a ""new to you"" iPhone. This phone gets an A++ for having all promised parts and better than expected condition. You can't beat a price of $520 for this condition either! iPhone Xs Max 256gb (Space Gray): This phone had wear and tear scratches all over. Like they never used a case, but never dropped it either. This one was bought for my husband. He chose a refurbished Xs Max over the new 11 Pro Max because as a firefighter, he is extremely rough on his phones. $700 was way better than $1,500. He upgraded from an iPhone 6s. Other than the minor cosmetic issues, this phone has exceeded our expectations. It gets an A simply because of the cosmetics, which wear easily covered with a screen protector and an Otterbox. Over all, I do recommend this seller. And if you want to save some money, or you're buying a phone for your kids who will more than likely break it, don't be afraid to try a refurbished phone.

It gives you the option to select remove monitoring and goes through another factory reset. My package arrived a day earlier through FedEx. The lighting in my picture makes it seem if the top edge has a stain of a scuff. This is not the case.

Luckily the person I am buying it for isn't fussy but if you are BUYER BEWARE!!! The phone quality was very good otherwise and the storage capacity was as stated. Came with a charger, a plastic screen protector which is best replaced with a useful one and simple black snap case which does nothing to protect the phone. Instead of those things I would have preferred it at least come with the lighting/3.5mm jack converter or the earpods but nah. If you're going to order this, I hope you're not too fussy about which model iPhone or colour you're getting cause it's clearly up in the air. Edit: 2 months later after the person whom I gifted this to started to use the phone, it couldn't hold any charge. Turns out the battery was defective.

It was just impossible. 3) the screen was of so disgusting quality that I could not look at it normally. he had different colors and the maximum screen brightness was very small.

This order was advertised as an Amazon Renewed product which ensured a real, working product. Mine came a day later than the 2-day shipping but I did not mind too much. The package came with an off-brand charger and no headphones but I was not worried about that either. The issue with the order was the actual phone itself! It was actually not GSM unlocked but ""Verizon"" unlocked. I was so fed up trying to get it connected to my current carrier (over 3 phone calls and two hours later) that I took it to a Verizon store to get connected there. I was not happy to have to switch carriers completely but I was desperate to have a working phone by then. Once I got to the Verizon store they looked at the top left of the screen and said it did seem like a Verizon phone as it says ""VERIZON"" by the Wifi icons. However, when trying to set up service they ran the serial number and found that this ""Verizon"" phone was unrecognizable. After I told him this was my THIRD TIME trying to connect this phone with a carrier he advised that I return it right away. It seems I was either sold a locked or a FAKE phone. My boyfriend's iPhone 7 from a different seller works fine, is great quality, and was easy to set up. Do NOT buy from this seller. You will be wasting a lot of time!

The charging adapter looked very very cheap, and cable says made by iqiyi, and probably they will go bad soon, as I have experienced those issues with not genuine charging cable previously. For genuine apple products: adapter costs 20$, lightining cable 20$, lightining to 3.5 mm jack 9$, earpods with lightining connectors 30$.

That doesn't matter to me, as I already had one at home anyway. The iPad charged up as expected and without issue with the charger I had at home. The device comes with a 90-day warranty through DealFisher, but as far as the Apple limited warranty, my device's coverage was already expired.

B07D42T6MB,"Don Quixote, et al.",5,"February 21, 2019",True,"Took a risk on ""Amazon Renewed"" and so far, very pleasantly surprised and relieved","[NOTE: This is an initial review, and I'm very happy. If anything changes, I'll update the review later.] I've had both good and bad previous experiences buying refurbished/restocked items at Amazon and elsewhere. It's a risk, and I always make sure I have the option to return the item. This time, it appears I've lucked out, in a VERY good way. I should note that I purchased from the seller ""Prime Mobility"" and can't speak to whether other sellers are as good. I chose this seller based on the number/percentage of previous positive reviews. I debated whether to buy this iPad Pro via Amazon Renewed. I was a little worried about some of the problems previous buyers mentioned in negative reviews (for all sellers). But in the end, the HUGE cost savings were worth possibly being inconvenienced by needing to return a bad item. I bought the iPad Pro 9.7"" with the additional cellular functionality AND the 256GB hard drive. These same specs currently cost $700 through Apple's official Certified Refurbished Program (and they don't have the Space Gray color I wanted). I was able to get it here for under $400, which was insanely low and worth the risk. The item arrived in a generic brown box (not Apple-branded), but was very professionally packed and protected. I didn't know what to expect, but honestly was really, pleasantly surprised. If I hadn't known it was sold as refurbished, I wouldn't be able to tell it wasn't new. It didn't look just acceptable or good: it looked actually brand new, as if I'd gotten it from Apple. No scratches, dents or even dust/fingerprints. It's fully possible this was an Open-Box item that has never been used, and was just repackaged. It even came in the same custom, form-fitting plastic packaging sleeve Apple uses, which increases my hunch it's never actually been used. Maybe I just got lucky, but I'm not complaining. The ONLY small negative was that it came without any initial charge, and a correct but unimpressive third party charger, but that's NOT a big deal if you're saving over $300. When I placed my order, I'd also spent $15 on a very high quality Anker charger and cable, so was prepared, and just charged it for a couple of hours before set-up. Reviewers complaining so much about the chargers need to realize how cheap good replacements are, and that this is a very small matter compared to the massive savings on the tablet. You should always have an extra charger anyway, so just buy a couple of good, cheap spares. Setting up the tablet has gone perfectly, and I had no trouble updating to the newest iOS, using the fingerprint sensor, setting up wifi or installing my cellular data SIM card. Everything seems to work perfectly (I checked every function to be sure), and it runs like an iPad straight from the factory. For all intents and purposes, I now have a a tablet indistinguishable from a NEW iPad Pro or a certified refurbished one from Apple. I'll update this review if any problems arise in the next month, but so far the item has me confident this won't happen. I'm very glad I took the risk of buying this refurbished/renewed, and was able to get the tablet for a huge discount.",17.0,Apple,Apple iPad Pro 9.7in 256GB Gold WiFi + 4G Cellular ( )(Renewed)

As an art student, I take TONS of pictures, and the camera is the primary reason why I got the iPhone X. I took it to multiple IT stores where they told me to either return the phone or to jailbreak it to rewrite the lines of code that affect the feature (and jailbreaking voids any warranty or service that Apple offers). I'm returning it because it's too big of a hiccup to work around (can't take pictures in a wedding/library/quiet setting at all...!).

B07D6TQP6F,Chad Bambrick,1,"September 19, 2019",True,Not as they claim,"This item is claimed to be a ""functioning like new"" device, but this is NOT TRUE AT ALL. Let me walk through this dramatic tragedy in detail. I had been monitoring the package from the moment after purchase, so it wasn't an accident that on that bright, sunny day I was waiting by the mailbox as the delivery truck cruised in. Grabbing my package, I ran inside, ecstatic at the prospect of my newest gadget. Gazing at that chrome-plated beauty, I knew love at first sight was true. As I set up this electronic treasure, I tap into ""settings"" to feast my eyes on the sight you rarely see in an iPhone... the battery at full capacity reader proudly gleaming a 100% like-new condition. But no, what sight met my eyes gave me a horror as you would not believe. Eighty....... Three...... Percent...... Now my mind was racing. I had already vowed til death do us part, but now looking at my bride's screen I realized what I had to do. I needed a second doctors opinion. I scheduled an appointment as soon as we returned from the honeymoon with Apple Memorial Hospital, and settled in to an uneasy vacation with my new love.... it was then that tragedy struck. As I started editing a slow motion video of a man breaking an egg on his forehead, the screen flickered and died. I gently tried to shake her awake, hitting the power and volume button up and down (Mainly down. A volume button being obviously a huge plus on a wife) As I rushed her to the ER at the nearest Apple Memorial Hospital I feared the worst. And the worst is what I got. Her heart, (known as a smart board) had failed. She would never speak to me again. I never saw her eyes open since that day, and I'll never forget the last image I saw of her, as the egg was making it's final impact on that man's head. I don't tell this story for self pity. I realize that this may be emotional for many of you to recall similar moments in your life's past. Perhaps even recent past. I share this only from a place of love and concern for other members of this community in the Amazon, that you don't make the same mistakes as I did. I will add one last word and say I have found support groups especially helpful during this emotional time. Thank you all for your time, and I hope you never buy.. *ahem, marry* a bride from this father-in-law. Happy phone hunting!",4.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone X, 256GB, Silver - For AT&T (Renewed)"

Kudos to the seller Electronic Deals who sent this one like new and made me happy for the upgrade from iPhone 6 to iPhone X.

Battery is great, face ID is amazing, but after reading a lot of the reviews I‚Äôd say that I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying from this seller. They are difficult to contact and if you have any problems they seem to turn you away and blame the buyer. Yes, it‚Äôs a good deal considering this phone was originally sold at $1000, but i‚Äôve read reviews that the phone was locked because of the difference in country, it was originally stolen or the phone plan hasn‚Äôt been entirely paid off. Also, their ‚Äúrefurbishments‚Äù aren‚Äôt really refurbishments. Again, I feel like I got extremely lucky with my phone. There‚Äôs only one problem that really isn‚Äôt that big of a problem.

I tried to submit a warranty request for their 90 day warranty but they wanted me to return the phone and be without one for more than a week and go through another 10hrs of wiping data and reloading data/signing in and setting up apps. I was also out of the country and couldn‚Äôt do that. Anyway they still get one extra star for providing decent service and having an ok product. After I fix these things though could have just bought a new one. So think about that first. You might get lucky.

B07D6TQP6F,Alex,2,"August 11, 2018",False,iPhone X After Half A Years Use,"I would first like to say that I have supported apple for a long time but this phone is unreliable and not worth the money. I have held off on writing a review in hopes that this phone would improve but it continues to be crap. My first issue with this phone is it's lack of a headphone jack. Now when I purchased this phone I knew I would have to carry around an adapter and I was willing to accept that; however, I was not prepared for my phone to not play music or connect even when I had said adapter. Furthermore, it used to not continuously charge meaning I would constantly have to re-plug it in and now it refuses to charge all together. Also, it will stop playing songs or Siri will turn on (even after I disabled her) for no reason. In addition, the camera will constantly freeze when I try to zoom in which has often stopped me from taking amazing photos. All in all this phone is glitchy, not worth the money, ugly (I mean did they really think making the top dip down was a good idea?), and will ultimately annoy you to the point where you have to write a rant online and not even on the official website because apple doesn't want to hear people's opinions.",28.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone X, 256GB, Silver - For AT&T (Renewed)"
B07D6TQP6F,Christopher Galgon,4,"September 1, 2018",False,"The Cell Phone Equivalent of a Concept Car, for Better and Worse.","The iPhone X is the most exciting phone I've owned since the iPhone 3GS so many years ago. I only recently had an opportunity to get one and it looks amazing, its cameras are spectacular and its quickness can be felt everywhere. Apple knew their design would be exciting, so they skipped over number 9 and made it the ""10,"" as if to say they're showing you a window to the future, just like a concept car. But as we all know, concept cars rarely end up on the assembly line without a few changes, and with good reason. Here's why the iPhone X, for all its power and beauty, really just deserves a ""B"" for its design: 1) The phone's signature looks turn anonymous inside a case. 2) The phone's surfaces all scratch easily. 3) It is the most slippery phone I've ever encountered. Add these things together, and you have a beautiful phone that MUST be put in an obscuring case, which makes its beauty kind of pointless. Inside a case and switched off, it doesn't even have Apple's signature circular button to identify itself. As of right now, I only have glass protectors on the front and back, but I know what will happen if I keep it like this long-term. The other new feature on the iPhone X is Face ID, or ""expensive way to avoid having a button on the front of the phone."" It works fine, but requires mild adjustments in how you use your phone and is definitely no better than Touch ID. I turned off the ""attention detection,"" meaning I don't have to be looking directly at the phone to unlock it, and now it is quick and unobtrusive. Finally, there's the ""notch."" This is a non-issue. I don't know what the fuss is about unless you're a software designer. Moving on. All in all, I've had my iPhone X for a couple months and couldn't be happier. It is not perfect, and I'll bet it'll be completely replaced by Fall 2019 (now that designer Jonny Ive is back in charge), but I'm loving everything about it.

Then after some researched I learnt that all iphones from Japan are like this because it‚Äôs illegal to take photos in public on silent. Last thing is the battery life. It came with 97% capacity which is amazing but it goes kinda fast like my old phone but after watching some YouTube videos I think its just how iPhone 8s are because of all these running apps and stuff so I did turn siri and some few things off and it surprisingly improved my battery health a lot. So I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs how the iPhone 8s are. And also if you wanna buy this get the red one its beautifullllllüòç. Mine came a with 0 scratches very neat with the charger( not original but its still very good) all nicely in a white box and you can buy this with confidence because you know there‚Äôs a 30 day or i think three months free return. And also I wanted to use this with simple mobile but it didn‚Äôt work so I currently use h2o wireless which is bum a**. Hope this review helped its üíØ percent honest.

B07KFNRQ5S,AARAWN,5,"December 9, 2018",False,Best smartphone made (not kidding),"I‚Äôve owned my iPhone XS Max for a little over a month now. Let me say this, I started with the original iPhone and kept them through the 4S. I made the switch to Galaxy, and had those through the S6 Edge. Made the switch back and I can tell you my user experience is better than any phone ever. I was definitely the one that argued Galaxy are superior. For many reasons they are. I‚Äôve played with the X, and was disappointed. Pros: Battery life is superior to anything I‚Äôve owned Reception hands down is the BEST. I can use it without issue in the big department stores that plague everyone. The feel of this phone is luxury at minimum. It‚Äôs flawless in your hands. It‚Äôs faster than any galaxy or iPhone I‚Äôve ever used and tried (Note 8 and S9) The apps are just designed better. I am a very heavy user and stream EVERYTHING. I have never had an issue with reception, speed or lagging, ever. 3D Touch and face recognition are super fast and user friendly. I‚Äôve noticed face recognition gets better with use. It‚Äôs constantly calibrating, which means as you change, so it does. The camera, hands down is such an incredible quality. Both features and image quality. You know this about iPhone, and ignore marketing of other companies, it‚Äôs BS. Wireless charging is lightning fast Seamlessly connects with iPad and they automatically update each other with apps etc. THIS is super cool!!! The speakers are incredible! I actually have to turn it down a couple notches as it‚Äôs very loud The new Gold is just absolutely stunning. The backing is a pearlized gold and the trim around it is a classy and metal gold. Stunning Cons: Pricey No headphone jack All glass (doesn‚Äôt bother me as I am extremely careful with my phones) but the average person that drops, you need to put a case on. No headphones included No cable included (I bought a 5 pack from Amazon anyway beforehand, so it‚Äôs a non issue) The notch. Bit of an odd eyesore but in turn I get HD quality calls and reverse camera functionality) Overall this truly is an incredible device.",146.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone Xs Max, 256GB, Space Gray - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)"
B07KFNRQ5S,Alexis Argueta,4,"February 15, 2019",False,Review,"INTRO I bought the iPhone XS Max on the first day it came out on September 12, 2018. I purchased the 64gb gold model. I have owned other iPhones in the past such as the 6 and 8 plus and many other Apple products. I‚Äôve also had Androids and many different types of PC‚Äôs. In this review I will focus on mainly the camera and battery. IDEAL USER The ideal user for the iPhone XS Max would be someone who has owned an iPhone before. The reason I say this is because it has so many similarities to its previous models such as the format of the apps. Also, the shortcuts on this new iPhone are extremely similar to the old generations. CAMERA In my opinion, the iPhone XS Max camera is one of the best and offers amazing advantages. There is this new feature where you can now change the depth of field of a picture that has already been taken. Another plus is that you can do this to photos that have taken by both the front and back camera unlike androids. Some androids can also adjust the depth of field but only before the picture is taken and not after. I use this feature all the time and improves the picture dramatically, making them look professionally taken. BATTERY LIFE The battery life for the iPhone XS Max is the biggest battery that has ever been on a iPhone. It can even last an hour a half longer than its previous model the X. I start off my day with a fully charged phone every day and stream music, watch videos, roam social media for hours and it does not die. It is at a low percentage, but it still has battery. So basically, one full charge can last you the whole day maybe even two. OVERALL Overall, this phone is good phone for anyone who wants to upgrade from their older generation model. The camera will never fail you, it‚Äôs the best on the market and offers many editing abilities with the camera. The battery is so big on the XS Max that you won‚Äôt always need to carry your charger with you. These are the only things I could talk about in a short review because this phone has so many advantages.",88.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone Xs Max, 256GB, Space Gray - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)"

B07KFNRQ5S,Daniel T.,3,"July 25, 2019",True,So far so great!,"I was initially skeptical about buying a used phone, but the experience so far has been great. I've been playing with the phone for the past few days and held off before writing a review to test things out. There weren't any major scratches/dents on the device, with an exception to some small scratches on the stainless steel bezel. Those were probably inevitable anyways, and can easily be polished out with a Cape Cod cloth. The screen didn't have any scratches visible to the naked eye, and was in very good condition. One thing I have noticed is that when turned off the device takes sometimes up to 20 seconds or more before powering on, which I don't know if is common for iPhones as this is my first one. Another thing I thought I would be worried about is the battery health, which hasn't been a problem. In fact, the model I got was at 100%! This makes me believe it was either recently changed or Apple has some serious durability on their battery, as I've gone over a whole day without charging when starting at 100%. Everything feels fast, and works as it should. I also had some time left the original apple 1 year warranty, so should be covered for the next few months. Overall, I can't speak for other sellers, but SikkSound gave me a very good phone! However, I would recommend buying from a reputable seller on Amazon if you're going the used route, and to be able to make sure you can return if there are any problems, since it can honestly be a crapshoot from what I've read in other reviews.

B07KFNRQ5S,JS1124,5,"December 19, 2019",True,Beautiful phone with amazing performance.,"First off, I would like to provide my experience with purchasing a used phone. I was very hesitant with this one. But Amazon has a wonderful return policy so I thought, if it isn't what I'm expecting, I can always return it. The things I was very concerned about with previous reviews is if the phone had been wiped correctly to be set up as a new iPhone, if the phone had been previously stolen, if the phone is truly 'unlocked', if the storage space was as I ordered, or if the phone was even a genuine Apple product in the first place! Upon opening it, I did find some light scratching on the front and back glass. Of course, this is to be expected. I'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. The stainless steel band is SPOTLESS. I powered it on, it greeted me with Apple's famous multilingual 'Hello' screen. And THANKFULLY the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down. I set it up with my Apple ID and went straight to settings. I checked the Serial Number at Apple's website. And was so happy that what I received was a 100% genuine XS Max. I was also very happy to discover that the storage was what I ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. I also checked the battery health which is at 98%. Leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before. Everything checks out, I am thrilled! Coming from an iPhone 8 Plus, I notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. But the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. And have I mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? I'm really happy I chose the XS Max over the 11 Pro Max. Mainly because of the extremely ugly new camera on it. Being a huge fan of Touch ID, I was very upset about having to switch to Face ID. But honestly, it's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you. Now, Performance. This phone excels at pretty much all that I ask it to. Games are faster and smoother than I've ever experienced on a mobile device. (Even the Note 9 I had.) And the new OLED Super Retina Display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. The blacks are SO dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. The camera is unbelievable too. Photos are sharp with detail and the colors are impressive. So overall, my experience of purchasing a used phone couldn't have gone smoother. I am very happy with it! Just make sure you buy from a seller with a bunch of great reviews and you'll most likely get a truthful and legit product like I did.",1.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone Xs Max, 256GB, Space Gray - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)"

Luckily screen is OK because there is a screen protector. But the protector was put on slanted so it is an eye sore itself.

I upgraded from an iPhone X and over time i have become pretty attached to the clarity of the screen and display overall. The performance of this phone accompanied by the clear camera and 4K video quality, certainly brings much to the table .

This phone starts to deteriorate pretty quickly; it‚Äôs only been around 5 months and the screen does not work as well; and there are so many actions this phone can do; I spent like guessing 5 to 10 percent of my time on it; correcting errors. 20 percent of the time I touch an icon; it doesn‚Äôt activate; but instead swipes left or right. I should be an expert on touching icons by now; yet still it happens. The apps this phone can use are really great and fun; but they need to seriously work on a hands free device and triple their man hours on the glitches and errors. Let the Chinese use the newest IOS for a year before releasing to the rest of the world; so they can deal with all the problems. One more thing; stop making the outside of the phone so slick; The slightest degree this phone is from horizontal, and there it falls off. You have to take the case off because it gets too hot, too quick. My screen dims like every five minutes.

B07KFNRQ5S,Jeff S,5,"December 4, 2018",False,Better than Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge,"Ok here is my review of my new iPhone XS Max. It replaces a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Battery: The battery is excellent and here‚Äôs why. Obviously the antenna in the Samsung was awful because I would use 30% of the battery traveling from Central Massachusetts to western Mass, a 50 mile trip but there would be spots where it couldn‚Äôt find a tower and the battery usage skyrocketed when that happened. This is not a problem with the iPhone, so the antenna must be way better, or whatever technology it is that‚Äôs different from Samsung, it‚Äôs better. I could never get through a day without needing to recharge the Galaxy. I use the phone a lot for listening to music (battery drain), Google searches, Instagram and Twitter. With the iPhone my usage has not changed if anything has increased due to the novelty of the new phone yet I have been able to get through every day (except the day of purchase when it was not fully charged out of the box) without charging the battery during the day. The iPhone, also doesn‚Äôt burn a hole in my pants pocket or heat other objects when it‚Äôs battery consumption is high. Antenna: Continuing on the antenna subject, I work in a Home Depot and the Samsung had issues getting reception and wifi in the store. No such issue with the XS Max. I also don‚Äôt lose reception where I did traveling on the road to western Mass. Music and speakers: The speakers in the iPhone are head and shoulders above the Galaxy and sound much more professional or like they are bigger. The sound is rich and full bodied and I don‚Äôt mind listening to music on the phone. Copying music to the phone took (6) minutes as opposed to an hour compared to the Galaxy when I had to do that when the Galaxy was new. That‚Äôs over 3000 songs if anyone is counting. The music interface is iTunes which was a learning curve but a quick one. I liked the music player I had in the Galaxy better but I‚Äôm still learning iTunes. Music also sounds better on my car stereo coming out of the iPhone than it did from the Galaxy. I had noticed this when my son would play a song I had on my phone using his iPhone in my car, the quality was significantly better coming from his phone which I thought was strange, but the same phenomenon exists with my new iPhone and my car. Siri: Where have you been all my life? Siri's functionality is far superior to the Galaxy‚Äôs S Voice. I don‚Äôt have to touch my iPhone to send texts, play music etc. I just have to tell Siri to do it, even if the phone is locked. This is a huge advantage over the Galaxy S Voice which is supposed to do the same thing but I could never get it to work consistently or even at all. Facial Recognition versus Finger Print Scanner: The iPhone facial recognition wins again. The only app I have needing finger print recognition is my bank app, but I am still able to use it by typing the password in. All other apps I have use facial recognition, Amazon, Starbucks, and other apps needing credit card authorization. There are more facial recognition apps than finger print scanner ones. Facial Recognition works even in really low light like darkness. Speed. The iPhone is Faster period. My Starbucks app took 30 seconds to load on my Galaxy, on the iPhone it takes 5 seconds; that‚Äôs significantly faster especially when you‚Äôre in line at the drive thru!!! Maybe that‚Äôs not a fair comparison but it‚Äôs reality. Screen Resolution: Here the Galaxy has the win, hands down. The iPhone is close but it just can‚Äôt compete with the Galaxy screen colors and resolution. It‚Äôs not a big enough of a difference maker considering all of the iPhone wins so far. That and the iPhone XS Max screen is actually larger edge to edge than the Galaxy. Camera: I don‚Äôt take many photos with the phone but what I have taken I do notice the Galaxy was better in the photo quality area. Jury still out on this one. Keyboard or keyboard apps: Galaxy wins here. At least until I find a swipe able keyboard I like as much as the one I had on the Galaxy. Look and Feel: iPhone wins over Galaxy S7 Edge because I grew tired of the edge screen causing issues. Such as touching the edge just a little, and it was hard to know you were touching it, would make the screen appear unresponsive. Even though the iPhone has an edge to edge screen it does not suffer from this behavior probably due to the way it fits in my hand. I am just glad I don‚Äôt have to hit the screen 7 times before I get a response. Size and weight: the XS Max is the same size as the Galaxy S7 Edge and weighs about the same, I know not scientific but their weight is similar. Tie Headphone jack: None on iPhone and who cares really? What you don‚Äôt own a pair of Bluetooth headphones already? But you‚Äôre spending how much on this phone??? Right, if you think the Headphone jack is a selling point you‚Äôre in the dark ages. As you can tell I like the iPhone a lot. Can‚Äôt believe I waited this long to switch. There was a time when I loved the Galaxy but that was when I first bought it.",12.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone Xs Max, 256GB, Space Gray - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)"

No scratches and shipped fairly quickly. The only complaint I have for the iPhone XS, in general, is that I really liked the fingerprint scan, sometimes the face recognition doesn't work when you're looking down.

They responded very quickly and told me I could either return it to them for another ""renewed"" one or take it to the Apple store since it was still under warranty. We took it to the Apple store. They looked at it and did some diagnostics right in the store and the phone self reported that the microphone was broken. Dealing with Apple was horrible - in short it took 2 months, 3 trips (7 hours total) at the the Apple store before we had a phone that worked. The renewed cellular people were nice and quick to respond but the fact that the phone self reported a broken microphone and they still sold it is upsetting. This phone should not have been sold and they could easily tell it was not fixed (the ""scan"" took 2 minutes in the store). I can't hold the horrible experience at Apple against this seller but from Apple I got a new phone and I didn't want to take the chance on another renewed one from the seller - as it was obvious their check is not thorough.

The 11 was already announced when we got this, but he didn't like the 11 (not pro) because it was bigger and more expensive and the screen on this is a lot better. The phone as a whole is alright. The cameras are what you can expect from an iPhone (awesome). It's just hard to explain to him why it doesn't have a headphone jack and what happened to the fingerprint scanner. If it had those two it'd be a great phone, but it'll have to settle for being just a great iPhone. Also, the price stung a lot. He says sometimes regrets not getting a Samsung S10 because that did have all the features he wanted for less price and arguably similar quality. Yet, he really likes iOS, and that transition would be a little difficult for him. So to wrap it up, if you're tied into the iOS ecosystem, this is a great phone.

When I tried to turn it on, it would display that ""Connect to iTunes"" picture.

B07RDMLR4V,AARAWN,5,"December 9, 2018",False,Best smartphone made (not kidding),"I‚Äôve owned my iPhone XS Max for a little over a month now. Let me say this, I started with the original iPhone and kept them through the 4S. I made the switch to Galaxy, and had those through the S6 Edge. Made the switch back and I can tell you my user experience is better than any phone ever. I was definitely the one that argued Galaxy are superior. For many reasons they are. I‚Äôve played with the X, and was disappointed. Pros: Battery life is superior to anything I‚Äôve owned Reception hands down is the BEST. I can use it without issue in the big department stores that plague everyone. The feel of this phone is luxury at minimum. It‚Äôs flawless in your hands. It‚Äôs faster than any galaxy or iPhone I‚Äôve ever used and tried (Note 8 and S9) The apps are just designed better. I am a very heavy user and stream EVERYTHING. I have never had an issue with reception, speed or lagging, ever. 3D Touch and face recognition are super fast and user friendly. I‚Äôve noticed face recognition gets better with use. It‚Äôs constantly calibrating, which means as you change, so it does. The camera, hands down is such an incredible quality. Both features and image quality. You know this about iPhone, and ignore marketing of other companies, it‚Äôs BS. Wireless charging is lightning fast Seamlessly connects with iPad and they automatically update each other with apps etc. THIS is super cool!!! The speakers are incredible! I actually have to turn it down a couple notches as it‚Äôs very loud The new Gold is just absolutely stunning. The backing is a pearlized gold and the trim around it is a classy and metal gold. Stunning Cons: Pricey No headphone jack All glass (doesn‚Äôt bother me as I am extremely careful with my phones) but the average person that drops, you need to put a case on. No headphones included No cable included (I bought a 5 pack from Amazon anyway beforehand, so it‚Äôs a non issue) The notch. Bit of an odd eyesore but in turn I get HD quality calls and reverse camera functionality) Overall this truly is an incredible device.",146.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone XS Max, 256GB, Gray - For AT&T (Renewed)"
B07RDMLR4V,Alexis Argueta,4,"February 15, 2019",False,Review,"INTRO I bought the iPhone XS Max on the first day it came out on September 12, 2018. I purchased the 64gb gold model. I have owned other iPhones in the past such as the 6 and 8 plus and many other Apple products. I‚Äôve also had Androids and many different types of PC‚Äôs. In this review I will focus on mainly the camera and battery. IDEAL USER The ideal user for the iPhone XS Max would be someone who has owned an iPhone before. The reason I say this is because it has so many similarities to its previous models such as the format of the apps. Also, the shortcuts on this new iPhone are extremely similar to the old generations. CAMERA In my opinion, the iPhone XS Max camera is one of the best and offers amazing advantages. There is this new feature where you can now change the depth of field of a picture that has already been taken. Another plus is that you can do this to photos that have taken by both the front and back camera unlike androids. Some androids can also adjust the depth of field but only before the picture is taken and not after. I use this feature all the time and improves the picture dramatically, making them look professionally taken. BATTERY LIFE The battery life for the iPhone XS Max is the biggest battery that has ever been on a iPhone. It can even last an hour a half longer than its previous model the X. I start off my day with a fully charged phone every day and stream music, watch videos, roam social media for hours and it does not die. It is at a low percentage, but it still has battery. So basically, one full charge can last you the whole day maybe even two. OVERALL Overall, this phone is good phone for anyone who wants to upgrade from their older generation model. The camera will never fail you, it‚Äôs the best on the market and offers many editing abilities with the camera. The battery is so big on the XS Max that you won‚Äôt always need to carry your charger with you. These are the only things I could talk about in a short review because this phone has so many advantages.",88.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone XS Max, 256GB, Gray - For AT&T (Renewed)"

B07RDMLR4V,Daniel T.,3,"July 25, 2019",True,So far so great!,"I was initially skeptical about buying a used phone, but the experience so far has been great. I've been playing with the phone for the past few days and held off before writing a review to test things out. There weren't any major scratches/dents on the device, with an exception to some small scratches on the stainless steel bezel. Those were probably inevitable anyways, and can easily be polished out with a Cape Cod cloth. The screen didn't have any scratches visible to the naked eye, and was in very good condition. One thing I have noticed is that when turned off the device takes sometimes up to 20 seconds or more before powering on, which I don't know if is common for iPhones as this is my first one. Another thing I thought I would be worried about is the battery health, which hasn't been a problem. In fact, the model I got was at 100%! This makes me believe it was either recently changed or Apple has some serious durability on their battery, as I've gone over a whole day without charging when starting at 100%. Everything feels fast, and works as it should. I also had some time left the original apple 1 year warranty, so should be covered for the next few months. Overall, I can't speak for other sellers, but SikkSound gave me a very good phone! However, I would recommend buying from a reputable seller on Amazon if you're going the used route, and to be able to make sure you can return if there are any problems, since it can honestly be a crapshoot from what I've read in other reviews. I will update my rating if anything changes or goes wrong with the phone. EDIT: After using the phone for just a few months, there is now a speaker problem with the speaker. It has a very noticeable distortion when playing audio. I haven't exposed it to water or dropped it at all.

B07RDMLR4V,JS1124,5,"December 19, 2019",True,Beautiful phone with amazing performance.,"First off, I would like to provide my experience with purchasing a used phone. I was very hesitant with this one. But Amazon has a wonderful return policy so I thought, if it isn't what I'm expecting, I can always return it. The things I was very concerned about with previous reviews is if the phone had been wiped correctly to be set up as a new iPhone, if the phone had been previously stolen, if the phone is truly 'unlocked', if the storage space was as I ordered, or if the phone was even a genuine Apple product in the first place! Upon opening it, I did find some light scratching on the front and back glass. Of course, this is to be expected. I'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. The stainless steel band is SPOTLESS. I powered it on, it greeted me with Apple's famous multilingual 'Hello' screen. And THANKFULLY the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down. I set it up with my Apple ID and went straight to settings. I checked the Serial Number at Apple's website. And was so happy that what I received was a 100% genuine XS Max. I was also very happy to discover that the storage was what I ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. I also checked the battery health which is at 98%. Leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before. Everything checks out, I am thrilled! Coming from an iPhone 8 Plus, I notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. But the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. And have I mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? I'm really happy I chose the XS Max over the 11 Pro Max. Mainly because of the extremely ugly new camera on it. Being a huge fan of Touch ID, I was very upset about having to switch to Face ID. But honestly, it's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you. Now, Performance. This phone excels at pretty much all that I ask it to. Games are faster and smoother than I've ever experienced on a mobile device. (Even the Note 9 I had.) And the new OLED Super Retina Display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. The blacks are SO dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. The camera is unbelievable too. Photos are sharp with detail and the colors are impressive. So overall, my experience of purchasing a used phone couldn't have gone smoother. I am very happy with it! Just make sure you buy from a seller with a bunch of great reviews and you'll most likely get a truthful and legit product like I did.",1.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone XS Max, 256GB, Gray - For AT&T (Renewed)"

I upgraded from an iPhone X and over time i have become pretty attached to the clarity of the screen and display overall. The performance of this phone accompanied by the clear camera and 4K video quality, certainly brings much to the table .

B07RDMLR4V,Whistler,2,"October 7, 2019",False,WAY to many issues; get a laptop instead for the same price.,"You don‚Äôt realize how heavy a phone can be until you are on it 6 hours a day. This phone starts to deteriorate pretty quickly; it‚Äôs only been around 5 months and the screen does not work as well; and there are so many actions this phone can do; I spent like guessing 5 to 10 percent of my time on it; correcting errors. 20 percent of the time I touch an icon; it doesn‚Äôt activate; but instead swipes left or right. I should be an expert on touching icons by now; yet still it happens. The apps this phone can use are really great and fun; but they need to seriously work on a hands free device and triple their man hours on the glitches and errors. Let the Chinese use the newest IOS for a year before releasing to the rest of the world; so they can deal with all the problems.

B07RDMLR4V,Jeff S,5,"December 4, 2018",False,Better than Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge,"Ok here is my review of my new iPhone XS Max. It replaces a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Battery: The battery is excellent and here‚Äôs why. Obviously the antenna in the Samsung was awful because I would use 30% of the battery traveling from Central Massachusetts to western Mass, a 50 mile trip but there would be spots where it couldn‚Äôt find a tower and the battery usage skyrocketed when that happened. This is not a problem with the iPhone, so the antenna must be way better, or whatever technology it is that‚Äôs different from Samsung, it‚Äôs better. I could never get through a day without needing to recharge the Galaxy. I use the phone a lot for listening to music (battery drain), Google searches, Instagram and Twitter. With the iPhone my usage has not changed if anything has increased due to the novelty of the new phone yet I have been able to get through every day (except the day of purchase when it was not fully charged out of the box) without charging the battery during the day. The iPhone, also doesn‚Äôt burn a hole in my pants pocket or heat other objects when it‚Äôs battery consumption is high. Antenna: Continuing on the antenna subject, I work in a Home Depot and the Samsung had issues getting reception and wifi in the store. No such issue with the XS Max. I also don‚Äôt lose reception where I did traveling on the road to western Mass. Music and speakers: The speakers in the iPhone are head and shoulders above the Galaxy and sound much more professional or like they are bigger. The sound is rich and full bodied and I don‚Äôt mind listening to music on the phone. Copying music to the phone took (6) minutes as opposed to an hour compared to the Galaxy when I had to do that when the Galaxy was new. That‚Äôs over 3000 songs if anyone is counting. The music interface is iTunes which was a learning curve but a quick one. I liked the music player I had in the Galaxy better but I‚Äôm still learning iTunes. Music also sounds better on my car stereo coming out of the iPhone than it did from the Galaxy. I had noticed this when my son would play a song I had on my phone using his iPhone in my car, the quality was significantly better coming from his phone which I thought was strange, but the same phenomenon exists with my new iPhone and my car. Siri: Where have you been all my life? Siri's functionality is far superior to the Galaxy‚Äôs S Voice. I don‚Äôt have to touch my iPhone to send texts, play music etc. I just have to tell Siri to do it, even if the phone is locked. This is a huge advantage over the Galaxy S Voice which is supposed to do the same thing but I could never get it to work consistently or even at all. Facial Recognition versus Finger Print Scanner: The iPhone facial recognition wins again. The only app I have needing finger print recognition is my bank app, but I am still able to use it by typing the password in. All other apps I have use facial recognition, Amazon, Starbucks, and other apps needing credit card authorization. There are more facial recognition apps than finger print scanner ones. Facial Recognition works even in really low light like darkness. Speed. The iPhone is Faster period. My Starbucks app took 30 seconds to load on my Galaxy, on the iPhone it takes 5 seconds; that‚Äôs significantly faster especially when you‚Äôre in line at the drive thru!!! Maybe that‚Äôs not a fair comparison but it‚Äôs reality. Screen Resolution: Here the Galaxy has the win, hands down. The iPhone is close but it just can‚Äôt compete with the Galaxy screen colors and resolution. It‚Äôs not a big enough of a difference maker considering all of the iPhone wins so far. That and the iPhone XS Max screen is actually larger edge to edge than the Galaxy. Camera: I don‚Äôt take many photos with the phone but what I have taken I do notice the Galaxy was better in the photo quality area. Jury still out on this one. Keyboard or keyboard apps: Galaxy wins here. At least until I find a swipe able keyboard I like as much as the one I had on the Galaxy. Look and Feel: iPhone wins over Galaxy S7 Edge because I grew tired of the edge screen causing issues. Such as touching the edge just a little, and it was hard to know you were touching it, would make the screen appear unresponsive. Even though the iPhone has an edge to edge screen it does not suffer from this behavior probably due to the way it fits in my hand. I am just glad I don‚Äôt have to hit the screen 7 times before I get a response. Size and weight: the XS Max is the same size as the Galaxy S7 Edge and weighs about the same, I know not scientific but their weight is similar. Tie Headphone jack: None on iPhone and who cares really? What you don‚Äôt own a pair of Bluetooth headphones already? But you‚Äôre spending how much on this phone??? Right, if you think the Headphone jack is a selling point you‚Äôre in the dark ages. As you can tell I like the iPhone a lot. Can‚Äôt believe I waited this long to switch.

The cameras are what you can expect from an iPhone (awesome). It's just hard to explain to him why it doesn't have a headphone jack and what happened to the fingerprint scanner. If it had those two it'd be a great phone, but it'll have to settle for being just a great iPhone. Also, the price stung a lot. He says sometimes regrets not getting a Samsung S10 because that did have all the features he wanted for less price and arguably similar quality. Yet, he really likes iOS, and that transition would be a little difficult for him. So to wrap it up, if you're tied into the iOS ecosystem, this is a great phone.

B07RT1X4FJ,Glen,1,"November 13, 2019",True,"Dud phone, likely due to tampering","These people tamper with the phones in order to unlock them, in my case it arrived unable to be updated to any version of iOS, rendering it useless, as you have to update to restore from backup. It's also unable to be restored to complete factory reset (through the recovery screen reset method using itunes). I got on the phone with them and they told me to ""Wait a couple of days"" because there's a problem at apple's end. Joke is on them, I talked to apple to try and get this thing updated but no matter what we tried it was impossible. The phone is a dud and they want me to wait a few days? Get real!",3.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone XS, 256GB, Gray - For AT&T (Renewed)"
B07RT1X4FJ,Reiki Chef Farmboy,1,"November 27, 2019",True,Scratched AF. Beat down phone.,"Phone works fine, but the claim ‚Äúlooks like new‚Äù is a joke. I tried twice ordering from the same seller and the condition was worse the 2nd time. Covered in scratches and battery life depleted to 86%. Sad, irritating experience and sellers route of recourse was to call a phone number that responded ‚Äúmailbox full‚Äù. Save yourself the frustration and order a phone directly from Apple.",3.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone XS, 256GB, Gray - For AT&T (Renewed)"
B07RT1X4FJ,Angelica Chavarria,4,"October 3, 2019",True,"Overall, i love!","Compared to my 6, it‚Äôs different. Took some time getting used to no home screen. Occasionally the data/ wifi connection gets iffy. I still have the same plan as i did w my 6 and still the same circumstances (same home wifi, same job/ school ect) calls/ facetime will occasionally freeze/ sound fuzzy if i am not connected to wifi. That was never a problem with my 6 (my 6 was a GSM unlocked, idk if that has anything to do with it) I wear glass, and sometimes the face ID does not recognize me if i do not have them on. Battery life is great! And i like being able to access low power mode easier than having to go through settings all the time! All in all, good phone. I can tell you one thing, it is not worth $600+. The raw materials used to make iphones are worth less than $10. This was the best price i found for this phone, so thank you!!!",,Apple,"Apple iPhone XS, 256GB, Gray - For AT&T (Renewed)"
B07RT1X4FJ,Tj,5,"November 30, 2019",True,Best Amazon buy yet!,I was Leary buying a renewed phone but was more than pleasantly surprised. The phone arrived totally unblemished and was just what I was looking for and was the right price. Setting up the phone which was a Verizon locked phone took only 15-20 minutes. Everything from my iPhone 7 was transferred first. I then installed the SIM card removed from the 7 and basically it was up and running. All of my worst fears never came true at all. The phone was totally wonderful and was exactly what was ordered. Looks feels and acts like a brand new iPhone XS.,,Apple,"Apple iPhone XS, 256GB, Gray - For AT&T (Renewed)"

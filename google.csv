B01LY3OB8D,S S.,1,"December 21, 2018",True,DO NOT BUY FROM KANGA,"My wife had her phone die in Sept. 2018. We purchased a BRAND NEW Google Pixel XL 128 on Amazon that evening thinking that it was coming form Google. The phone arrived on time and everything was fine. Fast forward 3 months to a week before Christmas, she woke up to a DEAD PHONE. I contacted Amazon and they referred me to Google Warranty Providers who informed me that the phone had NO WARRANTY. I tried for 3 days to contact the reseller and have not heard so much as a missed call, email or anser to the ticket I put in. If you are expecting any type of warranty on this product, you should NOT BUY THIS. Google refuses to do anything, even though they are required by law to stand behind their manufactured products, the seller is MIA and Amazon still allows them to sell. Google has at least escalated me to their technical team and I will update when I hear from them.",115.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver)
B01LY3OB8D,Micheal C,1,"August 19, 2018",True,"In less than 6 months of use, it has completely died","Until about 2 months ago, this phone was fantastic. But then the problems started: Overheating, random restarts (I keep very little in terms of apps or data directly on the phone, pulling it from the cloud whenever possible to try and mitigate this very issue). Recently however, this phone, which was supposed to be refurbished as new, completely died. I was looking at a website (text-based) when the phone froze, overheated to the point that it was more than a little bit uncomfortable to hold and then blacked out. I let the phone ""charge"" for several hours with no change. I've been told by a repair shop that this something that they cannot fix. This is unacceptable that a phone that costs $500 cannot seem to handle 6 months of regular use (Pandora and GPS while driving, and occasional web browsing while idling at my desk)",103.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver)
B01LY3OB8D,Emily's Menagerie,1,"June 13, 2019",True,These Phones are Timebombs,"Look into the 1st and 2nd gen pixel motherboards. They're faulty. I didn't know in March when I thought I would buy a brand new, technologically advanced, albeit older, phone to replace mine that had died. A class action lawsuit against google, for continuing to sell the phones after they knew there were motherboard issues, won in May 2019 and customers were paid out. But not on these amazon phones. 3 months of ownership and my $288 investment is a brick along with some recent pictures. Also the phone you are researching is surely out of warranty.

B01LY3OB8D,AnonZero,5,"September 13, 2018",True,"Best Pre-owned Phone Deal, Ever.","First I have to say that I'm extremely impressed with the service and product I recieved from GizmoTrader. The phone was in excellent condition as promised by the pics and when a small issue arose with the charger they sent me they immediately made things right by issuing a partial refund so that I could purchase another adapter asap. They're very consumer-friendly and they go the extra mile to take care of you. That being said, the Pixel XL itself is a wonderful device. If you have any reservations based on the fact that the phone is nearing two years old, they'll be dispelled once you get it in your hand. The screen is colorful and vibrant with deep blacks that only AMOLED can provide, the 3450mah battery delivers extended on- screen time, stock Android is snappy and responsive, updates come immediately, Android Pie is a nice upgrade over Oreo, 128GB of storage will last you a long time (I have 15 AAA mobile titles installed as well as over 8GB of music and I still have over 100GB remaining), the build quality is excellent and the semi-glass back helps radio reception a great deal. It has wifi calling, VoLTE, and so much more. And I haven't even addressed the camera yet. It's easily one of the best in the business. The Augmented Reality (AR) stickers allow you to place a 3D lifesize Stormtrooper in your livingroom and video him while he interacts with you and tracks your movements. You can put R2D2 in your bathroom, or Pogs in bed with you. It's amazing. You can customize stickers that look just like you and send them via MMS. But the camera; you have to research it for yourself, don't take my word for it. Sometimes I just take the Pixel out on family outings and leave my DSLR at home. It's especially impressive in low light situations where the HDR shines through. Add to that unlimited free cloud storage for all your photos and video, even 4K video. I'm sure I'm leaving out a ton of things about this phone but this review is a bit long already as it is. If you want a fast phone with the latest OS and a pro-level camera than grab the Pixel XL and don't look back. Then have fun chuckling to yourself when you see others with their overpriced Apple or Samsung devices that are still running last year's software.",36.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver)

Looked brand new, worked great...for about a month. 10 days after the return window closed, the phone died while sitting on a desk not being used. The entire month I had in in a protective case and took good care of it.

B01LY3OB8D,elguaposweater,5,"March 26, 2018",True,Good phone. Easy to use. Fast processing,"Bought this for my wife, who had been using a Galaxy S5 for a few years. She has been using the Pixel for a couple of months now and she really likes it. The transfer of her contacts etc from the old phone to the new was pretty seamless. We did have to go to the AT&T store to have the SIM card trimmed to fit the Pixel. She doesn't do many games, but she takes a lot of photos of our pets. Having the link to the cloud is nice so she doesn't burn through all memory.

B01LY3OB8D,Pinche Morrito,4,"June 29, 2018",True,Good phone overall. Just make sure you get a phone with a good battery,Great phone overall. Camera quality to me was 100 times better than the camera I had on my old iPhone 7 plus. Unfortunately the battery was bad on the refurbished unit. It went from 100% to 75% in 15 minutes.

B01LY3OB8D,Arky Pete,5,"July 13, 2019",True,"To save money, get a new/old smartphone","June 2019: I upgraded from a Nexus 6 to this Pixel XL. I bought the Nexus 6 four years ago--at least two generations behind at the time--and I loved it. Unfortunately over time it became short on memory, and the battery was no longer lasting all day. I'd also worn out the USB port. Moving to the Pixel XL still keeps me a couple generations behind, but then again the phone cost $200, not $800. The screen is better, the processor is faster, it has four times the memory the Nexus 6 had, and the battery lasts all day. It lacks inductive charging, but that's easily remedied with a wireless charging adaptor (Nillkin brand). Same ""Wow, I got a new phone!"" experience, but for a lot less money. Be sure to get the Spigen case and Spigen glass screen protector. They fit perfectly and do what they're supposed to.",14.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver)
B01LY3OB8D,Apple Cohen,5,"May 29, 2017",True,Great phone!,"I was previously on a Windows Lumia 830. I thought migrating to Android and Google Pixel would be a massive step up - in terms of speed of the OS switching between apps (response lag) and in terms of the phone quality itself. It turns out that the Windows OS is superior to Android - way better in fact - but of course no one makes apps for Windows...and Google navigation is great amongst other apps of course. ANyway, the phone is fast, but not lightening fast in terms of switching between apps and opening apps. But it does not frustrate - it is fast enough. The camera is awesome. 5 stars there.The fingerprint scanner is also excellent. The Pixel does not come preloaded with all the junk they load on Samsung, which is great. The S8 may be an object of beauty, but I wanted a phone that does not slow down due to apps overload and software layering. The Pixel has a an excellent build quality. Yes the screen does not curve to the edges, but so what. The phone works well, the signal strength is good. Chrome loads fast and the browser loads pages fast. VOice clarity on the phone is superb. I still need my phone to be a phone, and it does a great job in that area. Would I buy it again? Yes. Note - this phone was shipped to South Africa. It works 100% perfectly on any network here. Loud and clear, and fast on LTE. Note to the shipper - the packing was dismal. The box had no bubblewrap or any cushioning inside it. Very poor packaging. But the phone did arrive on time and DHL provided an awesome service.",30.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver)
B01LY3OB8D,Philly Buster,5,"January 31, 2019",True,Great phone for the money!!,"When this phone first came out, I wasn't interested because it didn't support wireless charging and didn't have an SD slot. So my wife and I went to Samsung. My daughter's LG G5 finally died and I needed to get her a replacement, quickly, and at an affordable price. When I saw this at the price it was offered for, I was shocked! The ""burner phones"" you get from ISPs aren't anywhere close to as good as a Pixel XL. We ordered it and haven't been disappointed. It's fast, comfortable and has a great screen. Sure, not as good as a Galaxy S8 or S9, but it's 1/4 the price!!! My daughter has been very happy with the phone.

B01LY3OB8D,ANDRE L. DE GRAAF,5,"October 8, 2018",True,Agree that this is the best phone out there and it is getting the latest version of Android when set up.,I love everything about this phone even the styling which many reviewers have criticized. The build quality is excellent and the android experience is super fast. Transfer from my LG G2 was painless and I could really see the difference between the phones once I was up and running. The camera is super fast to focus and now does not leave me frustrated. I can easily take in focus pictures of my non-stop 3 year old. Bought an older phone simply for the cost savings and I don't regret that I bought this phone when the pixel 3 is about to be released. I forgot to mention that the phone updated to Android Pie immediately! So this phone is getting the latest android software updates before any other android devices other than other Pixels!

The phone worked fine for a few months then she randomly started a bootloop died and went to hell. It would not turn on or do anything. I took it into Ubreakifix and was informed the motherboard was dead and they could do nothing for me. This was six weeks after product support expired. I had done nothing wrong. I treated her nice, bought her a pretty new case and screen protector and kept her safe from water. But ultimately I was duped and bamboozled. I never would have bought this phone had I known that a common issue is the motherboards randomly die through no fault of the user.

B01LY3OB8D,CL Pierce,5,"June 21, 2019",True,One of my favorite phone's I've had,"In the past, I've very much been the type of person to want a phone that just....was a phone, basically. No need for anything fancy. In the last year leading up to getting the Pixel, though, I had started trying to branch out more and started posting my art on social media, and found myself needing a phone that could record high-quality videos (bonus points for the ability to easily record time lapses) take high-quality photos, and still be able to store all of the aforementioned photos and videos AND multiple editing/social apps without me constantly having to delete content to make room for new things as I had with my previous phone. This phone fit the bill in all categories, even considering the fact that I use it WAY more often than I had previous phones. I left it outside for two hours recently in recording mode to catch a time lapse of the sun setting, and it was totally fine. No app crashing, no overheating, no shutting off or restarting unexpectedly, nada! I was afraid that the quality would decline after a few months as I had experienced before with several phones I've owned, I'm now 7 months in and have had 0 issues with it. Performance wise it's definitely one of the best phones *I've* ever owned, well worth the extra cost.",4.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver)

B01LY3OB8D,D. Macpherson,5,"May 25, 2019",True,Good so far,"Got the phone just a few days ago, so this is an early take. A steal of a price on Amazon. A $860 phone 2 years ago, paid $208 in new condition! Pro : Super easy set up. Included cable to download from old phone ( Moto G4) made transferring a breeze. All old settings including ring tones and stored music on old SD card transferred over. No micro SD card on Pixel phones (ala Apple) but 128 G storage on makes that irrelevant. Andoid 9 customization works great, IMHO better than IOS on wife's iPhone. Excellent hi resolution screen, super responsive operation. Camera seems very good in few early pics. Cons: Really none so far. Battery life so-so in first few days while doing lots of setup. Hope to get 2 days with more limited use and phone turned off at night (like old Moto phone).

B01LY3OB8D,Amazon Customer,1,"September 2, 2019",True,Maybe I got a lemon but this is just junk,"The merchant was fine - delivered on time. I know that it said the product could have scratches. There was a small 1/4 inch crack near the top light which was acceptable. The phone slipped from my hand to the counter and now the phone has a huge Y shaped crack starting at the top and branching out right in the middle of the glass with a 1/8"" pit, making it pretty much unusable. This was on the second day out of the box. I went to a screen repair place and I'm not spending>$125 to repair the phone when I paid $138. There are so many things I don't like about the phone: all videos buffer excessively so you can't watch movies, heats up to the point of you feeling you have to shut it down, only a limited number of notifications show so you can easily miss them, all the power cords are different so you have to charge before you go or buy all new cords to travel with, and slot more. I really regret my purchase. I've removed the SIM card and put it back in my old phone. I planned on trying to sell it after the first day on eBay but then dropped it a foot. I've never had a phone screen break, ever - I'm not rough on phones. Now I couldn't get $25.

I realize that the Google Pixel XL is not the newest version of the phone, but I bought it new and unlocked 128 GB for $200. Much more reasonable then purchasing the Google Pixel 3a for over $600. It's a solid phone and has the newest OS. There is plenty of room for all the apps I need/ want. I am able to use it on the page plus cellular network (Verizon 3rd party), and it makes cellphone ownership much more affordable. Having an unlocked phone is great because now I don't have to pay extra fees and I am not stuck in a lengthy contract. Through page plus cellular, it cost $30 flat a month for unlimited calls and text and 3GB of data.

The only fix I have found for that is to just reboot my phone but I'm starting to get worried because I have not had the phone for a month yet and I have had to do that at least 4 times already. I bought the phone brand new unlocked by the Google so I'm not sure what the problem is,3.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver)

B01LY3OB8D,Jam,5,"September 18, 2019",True,Awesome! Works and pretty much new.,"Came in the original packaging and had everything included, pretty much looks like the box was just re-sealed, everything else inside looks pretty much like getting the phone brand new. Everything was great, it was easy to set up and since google pixel phones are both GSM and CDMA compatible, you can pretty much go with any provider. Battery life it alright, not the most amazing for constant use when playing games but for just day to day use it holds up fine. The only issue i have with the pixel line is that since it's screen is curved, most screen protectors will have that ""halo"" effect on the sides since it doesn't want to stick down, but you get used to it. All in all great find for a renewed phone, 4 months in and still no complaints!",,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver)

I've gone through a phase of trying out and returning copious different ones from different places used and new and this lost to a new iPhome 6S and Galaxy 8. I don't know anyone else who has a Pixel but I have no idea why this is way better than the two and popular ones that didn't like as much. I would really highlight the great pictures this takes. I was never one for Snapchat or Instagram but now I find for some reason I take pictures more now and want to utilize other things that I wouldn't have before simply because the camera wasn't delivering noticeably stellar photos. I love the battery life too! The iPhone is terrible compared to this one and the Galaxy didn't preform too much better. I know that it's performance will decline over time but I never had a smartphone that I owned that started with a longer amount of battery life that would last with near non-stop usage.",,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver)

B01LY3OB8D,Whiskey Tango,4,"October 27, 2016",False,very nearly an iKiller; as impressive as it is expensive,"Google Pixel XL 4G LTE w/ 4Gb RAM, 32Gb device storage - Very Silver (direct from google) While I've demo-ed every Nexus phone that Google has fielded to date, none have ever held my interest. The Pixel XL is not just the latest iteration of ""Nexus"" smartphones. While falling far short of perfection, the Pixel XL still sets a very high bar of hardware design and tight software integration for the entire Android ecosystem to aspire to (if not fully exceed). This Google-branded foray into the high-end smartphone battlefield also falls short of being a full-blown iKiller, but it comes mighty close. First, mention must be made of where the Pixel XL fell short of perfection: - Non-user-removable internal battery While the Pixel XL's on-paper specs for active use and standby charge life are very impressive, consumer electronics Lithium-ion batteries suffer irreversible internal damage and loss of calendar life once they are discharged below 50% of their original factory full-charge rating. This is why so many iDevices wind up requiring battery replacement service after ~100-300 full discharge/charge cycles. That's fact, not apocryphal (and true for the majority of consumer electronics Lithium-ion batteries). Consumer electronics Lithium-ion batteries really benefit from being kept topped-off as much as possible (which is one reason that there's a huge after-market for external battery packs and a cottage industry for replacing failed internal batteries). But, no matter how hard one tries, smartphone batteries just wind up becoming discharged below 50%, which then shortens the calendar life of that battery. Then you have to pay, one way or another, sooner, rather than later, for replacement. Another Lithium-ion battery problem is physical shocks delivered to the battery. It not just S*ms*ng G*l*xy N*t* 7s that melt, catch fire and/or explode. Drop/shock ANY Lithium-ion battery hard enough and you have created an electro-chemical time-bomb that can go into internal cascade thermal overload at some unknowable/unpredictable future date/time. No ""safety circuitry"" can stop it, once it starts. Hard physical shocks can induce short-circuiting inside a consumer electronics Lithium-ion battery. So, you should quickly recycle and replace a Lithium-ion battery that has been physically shocked. These are but two VERY COMPELLING REASONS for end-user replaceable internal smartphone batteries. Yet, Google decided against it. - No built-in wireless charging capability While this is not a must-have, think about how much money Google wants for the Pixel XL and look around and see how many similarly priced smartphones natively support wireless charging. This is a surprising and retro disappointment in the PXL. - No extSDcard slot While this is in keeping with Google's long standing refusal to allow for user-expandable device storage, 32Gb of internal device storage is a pittance in the face of storing 4K video and so-called VR content. My existing production smartphone has 32Gb internal storage, which is 48% full, and a user-added 64Gb 95Mb/sec microSDXC card, which is 70% full. (I do run a number of professional network and IT testing tools on that smartphone, many from the extSdCard.) All of this would NEVER fit in 32Gb. And don't forget how much device storage must be kept freely available for full Android OS upgrades/updates. I don't care for cloud storage of personal/sensitive data, period. Even though Google promises free, unlimited, original resolution image/video cloud storage for Pixel customers, that's going to mostly be useless to me. I don't trust Google with much of anything that I can't automatically TNO-encrypt, pre-cloud, and maintain as TNO-encrypted in-cloud. Also, think about the data plan costs of moving high-res images and 4K videos to-and-from the cloud. And how well do you think 4K video streams over LTE? Cloud is not for me. Please, give me an option to fully utilize a fast 256Gb microSDXC on-board expansion card. Google's hob-nailed boot steps down on my neck by continuing to refuse to support high-speed/high-capacity expansion storage. That is kind of EVIL at these high price points in the Android universe. My push back is to use a USB3.1/USB-C external memory card reader with the PXL for literally external SDcard backup storage. Sadly, I can't conveniently run apps from the card reader, but I can keep tons of data backed-up and freely available to me without the vagaries of ""streaming."" (Just read the horror stories of people who lost way more than they bargained for by placing irreplaceable data in someone else's cloud storage. Yeah, that really does happen.) - The built-in speaker is mono only Again, for the price, look at how many similarly (and even lesser) priced smartphones have built-in stereo speakers. - Only rated IP53 for dust and water splash resistance Smartphone makers keep playing games with the resistance of their devices to environmental particulates and water damage. While I'm not demanding IP-68 rated full submersibility from Google, as long as smartphones continue to use cheap tin for solder joints and board traces, a phone as expensive as the Pixel XL can and should do better than IP-53. Please, Google, set a better standard for everyone else to match. None of these shortcomings are showstoppers, but they are all disappointing displays of Google's stubborn engineering arrogance/hubris. . And now, the MANY THINGS TO REALLY LIKE ABOUT THE PIXEL XL, things that are definitely iSLAMMERS... + Rapid battery charging, longer runtimes and standby charge Battery run times and standby charge life will depend on exactly how you use your phone. That said, the paper specs on the Pixel XLs 3450mAH battery are: 32 hrs LTE talk, 14 hrs LTE data, 14 hrs WiFi, 130 hrs music play, 14 hrs video play and 522 hrs standby. I don't personally expect to see these numbers, myself, because of my app loadout and tendency to find myself in areas of marginal to poor LTE signal coverage (inside Faraday-cage-like structures and/or high ambient EM/RF interference); but these numbers are beefy, nonetheless. As long as Nougat (Android 7.1) doesn't serve up any nasty runaway built-in services/processes, the PXL battery should outlast a Nexus 6 doing the same things. My other smartphone, even with its significantly bigger battery, doesn't come close to the PXL's promise. Google claims the PXL can be charged (from O?) to 7 hrs of talk time in 15 minutes. I have to interpolate 7 hrs talk to mean less than 25% of full charge. If charging rates are linear (which they may not be), that would imply a full charge in something over an hour of continuous charging. While I've never fully discharged the Lithium-ion battery in my production smartphone, I know that fully recovering from a 50% discharge takes slightly less than an hour, and that battery, fully charged, is supposed to hold 4900 mAH, which is considerably more than the PXL's 3450 mAH. So, I'm not sure how rapid Google's rapid charging actually is in comparison. In a real world charging test, with WiFi on, LTE/BT/NFC/GPS off, but PXL otherwise in standby, charging from 79% to 100% took 27 minutes. Another thing to keep in mind is that there's more to the safe and sane ""rapid"" charging of Lithium-ion batteries than just the basic dance of balancing voltage, current and internal temperature. The chemistry and physical internal structure of the battery has to specifically support rapid charging, too. Google is keeping totally mum on exactly which Lithium ion chemistry they chose for the Pixel XL's battery. I can say that the phone does not warm up, at all, during charging, very much unlike my other smartphones. I left a fully charged Pixel XL, with an equivalent production loadout of apps, on standby (WiFi off, LTE off, BT/NFC off, GPS off, Airplane mode on) side-by-side with an older smartphone (that also happens to have a much higher mAH battery than the Pixel XL), for nine hours. At the end of this test, the Pixel XL had drained 1% of it's full charge. The other smartphone drained 63% of it's full charge. Part of the Pixel XL's standby performance could be battery chemistry, part of it is definitely the advanced power management of the Snapdragon 821 cpu. + Bezel-ed 1440v2560 QuadHD AMOLED display The AMOLED display is outstanding even in broad daylight. 534 pixels per inch makes for very vivid/rich images. I don't have to shade the Pixel XL's screen to see what it's showing me in broad daylight. I'm also OK with the scratch resistant Gorilla Glass 4 (vs the more allegedly crack resistant Glass 5), because there's a functional bezel surrounding the screen's edges. (My PXL will live inside an Otter Box Defender case, too). I am adamantly pro-bezel for candybar style devices, as long as that bezel is both functional and durable. I'm not mounting the PXL up on a wall. I don't need any smartphone to be a functionally compromised ""work of art."" My PXL is always going to be in hand or standing by on a custom carry retractable rig or dash mounted. The purpose of a bezel, in my world, is to protect the edges of the glass from damage and prevent unintended screen touches/button presses. Bezels that don't do both are useless to me. Edge-to-edge, bezel-less screen glass really means, to me, more surface area to attract damage and more unintended taps/presses. The bezel on the PXL is AOK by me. + Android Nougat 7.1, Qualcomm Snapdragon 821+Adreno 530, 4GB RAM Pixel XL ships with factory Android 7.1 and keep in mind that Nougat on PXL is a different beast from Nougat on Nexus, and just about anything else, for now. Un-rooted Nougat allows forcing apps to extSdCard so that you may test for yourself whether or not they will run (sans widgets) from extSdCard, by overriding the app's manifest. More power to the End User is a good thing. Surprisingly, there is no real file manager on the PXL's Nougat and Chrome is the only factory installed Internet browser. If you need to setup Microsoft Exchange Server ActiveSync accounts, do *not* disable the Gmail app. Nougat 7.1's Settings | Accounts only lets you setup Google accounts if the Gmail app is disabled. The reasoning behind these decisions by Google eludes me. The Snapdragon 821 is a quad-core CPU, with two full-power and two low-power cores for maximizing performance while also aggressively managing power consumption. The GPU is Adreno 530, 4K and VR capable. RAM is LPDDR4 and absolutely necessary for software to continuously leverage hardware performance. Bravo on all counts. + Main Camera The Pixel XL's main camera is a Sony IMX378 12-megapixel image sensor, with photon gulping 1.55micron pixels and a f/2.0 aperture lens. Google's proprietary (and compute intensive) HDR+ technology makes it the fastest image capturing HDR camera available on a smartphone today, across a range of lighting levels. The PXL can shoot 30 fps 4K video (3840x2160) and uses software video image stabilization, rather than optical image stabilization. That software actively reads the Pixel XL's internal gyro-sensor (@200Hz) to rapidly compute adjustments for shakes/jiggles. Fewer physically moving parts is AOK by me. This camera has no optical zoom, only digital zoom. Normally, I'm an optical zoom bigot, but the Pixel XL's 4K-capable alchemy has expanded my opinion of digital zoom. Plus, if I insisted on optical zoom, I can always clamp on an appropriate third-party helper lens. By default, HDR+ is always enabled and the camera essentially always captures frames in video mode. For still photography, 10 of 30 RAW frames captured are then sampled/composited together to produce a final JPEG image. This alchemy of hardware and software synergy develops significantly better images than from any other smartphone that I have used. The PXL takes the fastest and best non-flash, low-light photos of any smartphone that I have owned. There are downsides though. The main cam can only shoot 12.3MP in 4:3 mode. The best you can get in 16:9 is 8.3MP, because you are cropping away some IMX378 sensor data to simulate a widescreen image. In all of the main camera video modes (720p, 1080p and 4K) you do not have granular control over frame rate. Google Camera v4.2.022.135443920 (a Google Play update to factory Nougat 7.1) does allow you to select a pre-determined high frame rate (""slow motion"") for video on the Pixel XL. Functioning as a GPS-enabled dashcam, the Pixel XL is so good at 1080P night vision that I wish it could project a heads-up display on the windshield. The levels of low-light illumination and contrast are quite remarkable, even with on-coming high beam lights. Everything remains in focus even when traversing pot holes and turns. The only limitation is that the 16x9 landscape video is not wide enough to catch all four corners when stopped at an intersection. An add-on lens will be required to widen the field of view. + 3.5 mm stereo headset jack, USB-C charging/connectivity port Hooray for the stereo headset jack! I deliberately don't use Bluetooth headsets of any kind and have ALWAYS used pro-grade wired headsets with cell phones from Day One, for brain EM/RF safety and conversation privacy. The even bigger deal, for me, is the USB-C charging and connectivity port. USB-C is the unifying data/power port of today and the future. It compliments and exceeds USB 3.1. Plug reversibility means there is no upside-down orientation. USB-C seriously future-proofs the Pixel XL across a wide array of companion devices that support USB-C, DisplayPort 1.3, HDMI 2.0 and/or USB 3.1 protocols. And there are adapter cables for legacy USB. The one thing to be aware of is that improperly terminated USB-C cables can inflict electrical component damage, so make sure you only obtain USB-C cables from reputable makers that properly implement the grounding specs. Because Android implements extSdCard as USB storage, I can use the PXL's USB-C port to connect a USB3.1 compliant, USB-C external memory card reader, which allows for memory card-based local data backup and rapid transfer of bulk data across devices. Google tells me that the PXL's USB-C port is a full implementation, so it is supposed to be able to push 4K video to an external monitor, using an appropriate adapter. + Google Assistant I personally don't trust Google and I'm far from alone in that. I have always HATED the annoying invasiveness of GoogleNOW and it's all-or-nothing ""privacy"" configurability. Now, we get Google Assistant, which is supposed to be gNOW ""on steroids."" (Similar/parallel concerns about privacy invasion and information hemorrhage make me equally despise Microsoft's cynical implementation of Cortana on Windows 10.) I don't want/need any corporation placing a digital diaper around my brain pan in a lop-sided trade for el corpo's definition of ""convenience."" It's bad enough as it is with three-letter-agencies peering into spaces that ought to be private/personal with zero value-add for me. Fortunately, I can go into Nougat's Settings and defang the leaking-to-the-cloud ""features"" in the Google app (trading away OK Google functionality) and Disable or (even better) Uninstall Android Pay, Gmail (with the previously mentioned caveat), Google+, Hangouts, OK Google enrollment, carrier bloatware, etc without ""rooting."" My privacy matters to me. My thought process is not for Google to reverse engineer. I do use highly effective applications, from non-affiliated vendors, for voice command, stand-alone/off-line navigation, traffic conditions, etc. I also use four different security hardened web browsers on each of my mobile devices. The Pixel XL will be no different (although finding reliable offline voice command is proving to be very tricky). Information about me that begins compartmented in the real world needs to stay that way, until I say otherwise, on a case-by-case basis. One time, blanket permissions are an insult to me. I also try not to put things into the cloud unless I can ""TNO"" encrypt, pre-cloud, and keep it that way in-cloud. The only way that Google Assistant can play a role in my world is if the bulk of the processing happens on-device, local to me, with highly granular permissions on and redactions of personally identifiable meta-data that I'm only then willing to share with Google or anyone else on a case-by-case basis. That and only that is Do-ing No Evil by Me. All of that is do-able, too, but Google just doesn't see fit to. + 24x7 technical support During my review of the Pixel XL, Google (not Verizon) pushed the ~33MB 05 Oct 2016 Security Update for Nougat 7.1 to my Pixel XL. (My high-end S... N... # is still waiting its 05 Oct Security Update for Marshmallow 6.0.1 from my ALWAYS-LATE-WITH-THE-PATCHES US other carrier.) Again, bravo, Google. Updates should be direct to device from Google for ALL Androids. 24x7 TS is a must as there is no PDF User Guide available for the Pixel XL. And, yes, it's really 24x7. The on-line FAQs are quaint. I haven't tried Chat Support. I have called in and not gotten answers to some questions that I've posed (like battery chemistry). And, yes, Google's engineers are working on the Bluetooth pairs, then summarily disconnects software bug. + Bottom Line I agree with others that the Pixel XL is very expensive, but, at this time, it's hard to find many of the PXL's features and functionality at any other price point. So, if you need what the PXL has to offer, then I do recommend it.",98.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver)

B01LY3OB8D,michaelpaul50,5,"May 23, 2017",False,Beware: Love Mine But Over 48 Phony 1 Star Reviews By People Who Never Bought A Pixel/Pixel XL Regarding Price/Features/Service,"UPDATE: FIRST: Do not understand why Amazon allows folks who have NEVER purchased a product to write reviews for that product? Of the 53 ONE star reviews the Pixel XL received, only 4, that's right, 4 were written by verified buyers. That's 1 verified buyer for every 13 reviews. In total, almost 1/3 of the ONE star reviews (not one from a verified buyer) were by folks who claimed to have paid at least $1,500, to as much as $2,000, for a Google Pixel XL that lists for $990. While another 1/3 of the ONE star reviews were by folks who clearly stated that they HAD NOT PURCHASED the Pixel/Pixel XL and WOULD NOT PURCHASE it because is was too expensive or they didn't like the provider's plan, mostly Verizon, which, in fact, has nothing to do with the cell. (Check their website, Verizon offers the same ""lousy"" plan whether you're buying a Pixel or a Samsung). Conversely, the Pixel/Pixel XL received about 50 FOUR AND FIVE star reviews of which 46 of the 50 or 92% are from verified buyers. That's almost comical. Only 8% of the ONE star reviews are from verified buyers while 93 % of the FOUR AND FIVE star reviews are from people who made clean, verified purchases through Amazon. Now, who am I supposed to give the greatest weight to? If you adjust the ratings to scrub all the "" One Stars"" attributed to ""not worth the outrageous price"" and the like and spread them evenly across TWO through FIVE Star ratings, then this phone would rate in the 4.2 to 4.3 range instead of 3.6, a 20% difference between make-believe and reality. Yet another unfortunate demonstration that one must read the ONE and TWO star ratings very, very carefully to weed through those left by folks who simply do not know what they are talking about. Sad, but all to often true. However, as a VERIFIED PURCHASER... After carefully reading all the new product reviews on sites such as CNET, Consumer Reports, The WSJ, and many more, I actually purchased a Pixel XL 128GB. No place, absolutely place I looked, had a list price for a new, 2017 Goggle Pixel XL 128GB Quite Black that exceeded $1,000. My Pixel XL 128GB Quite Black arrived about 10 days ago. I purchased an unlocked U.S. version from a merchant with a 97% 365 day Positive Rating fulfilled through Amazon with an Amazon A to z (doesn't work send it back within 30 days) warranty. I purchased an Universal SIM card from Sprint. They overnIghted the card to me and the local store installed it and transferred all the data. Total cost to me for the Pixel, SIM card, shipping, and taxes were $997. I am in 7th heaven.The phone is easy to use, has a one to one interface that lets you sync directly with any Windows firmware or software via cable or cloud, 100% drag and drop interface, UNLIMITED FREE cloud storage between ANY model Pixel and Google Cloud.

B01LY3OB8D,S. Chung,5,"November 10, 2016",False,The best Android phone on the market,"I was lucky enough to get a pre-order of the Pixel XL phone in as soon as it was announced by Google. In a nutshell, it is the best Android phone on the market today (Nov 2016). I have owned a Pixel XL, a Nexus 6P, and an iPhone 6S+, and I would rate them in that order (Pixel first, iPhone last). The hardware across all three seem comparable. The Pixel XL is noticeably lighter than the Nexus 6P, and it’s a little faster. But all three are pretty close in terms of performance. The big differentiator is the software. The Pixel XL comes with the latest version of Android N, with Google Assistant fully integrated. Nexus is also great and you can install the Google Assistant. The iPhone 6S+ is a distant third - iOS has gotten harder to use over the years and Siri just plain sucks. The Google Assistant has become my goto action on the phone, and it’s 100x better than Siri. Even though companies like Samsung also make good hardware, they just have to load up their phones with a ton of bloatware which is nearly impossible to get rid of. The very nice thing about “made by Google” phones is that it comes with the default stock Android operating system without all the additional bloatware that other phone makers add to theirs. Google also keeps it phones always up to date with the latest version of Android, whereas with other phone makers they often choose not to upgrade because it’s a lot of effort for them. So, the Pixel XL is the latest of the “made by Google” phones, and it is by far the best Android smartphone out there. Amazon doesn’t carry the Pixel phone - in fact Amazon won’t carry a lot of the “made by Google” products because Amazon considers Google a competitor (Google’s Home product competes with Amazon’s Echo, the Nexus tablet competes with the Kindle, etc.). So as of Nov 2016 you won’t find this phone on Amazon, with the exception that some smaller less-than-reputable companies pre-ordered a number of phones from Google and are now selling through Amazon with an exorbitant markup (~2x the retail price due to the high demand and short supply of these phones). I purchased my Pixel XL on the google store (store.google.com) at retail for $750+tax USD, that’s probably where you should go if you’re looking to buy one of these. Many of the reviews for the Pixel XL on Amazon are negative mainly in response to the price-gouging by the smaller resellers, you can ignore those because those reviews have nothing to do with the phone itself (they’re more directed at the companies trying to take consumers for a ride). So what do I like about the Pixel? - It’s fast and responsive, much like the Nexus 6P and iPhone 6S+. - Like the Nexus 6P, the fingerprint scanner is really fast and responsive, and placed in a MUCH better spot than the iPhone 6S+. It’s where the index finger naturally sits. - I really like the latest Android N software, and I really really like the integrated Google Assistant. - The external reviews made a big deal about the camera - after using it some I have to say it's quite good, even better than the iPhone 6S+ which I thought was already great for a phone camera. The phone is *much* faster than the Nexus 6P phone (meaning it takes the photo when you tap, not 1 second later), and takes excellent pictures in low light. - The camera app has gotten a lot better - the video recording now has a pause feature, and you can take 4K video! - Battery life is excellent, but again not much difference from the other two (which were also very good). - Like the Nexus 6P, this phone uses a USB-C charger, which means it charges very quickly. I don't have to charge overnight any more, plugging in once in a while keeps the battery mostly full all the time. - Google keeps its phones always up to date with the latest updates, much like Apple does with its iPhone. What don't I like about the Pixel XL? - The Nexus 6P had stereo speakers (one speaker on the bottom and one on top), whereas the Pixel has speakers only at the bottom. It's not bad, but you don’t get the same stereo effect as you did on the Nexus 6P. - Like the Nexus 6P, the volume buttons are pretty far down on the side, which makes it hard to use some hands-free car cradles that want to squeeze both sides of the phone without errantly changing your volume for you. - Like both the Nexus 6P and iPhone 6S+, sometimes when you take photos while capturing video you get a slight glitch in the video where you snapped the photo. C’mon Google, you should be able to fix that! - It doesn't have a micro-SD slot, you're stuck w. the storage the phone comes with. My overall recommendation is to buy this phone, it is the best out there. Right now you can get it through Verizon, or if you want to purchase the unlocked version you have to buy it from the google store. However, it’s expensive (similar cost to an iPhone). If you want a very similar made by Google phone at about half the price (since it’s a year older), I would also strongly recommend the Nexus 6P. It’s very similar to the Pixel XL, just a little heavier but it will get the latest Android N and the Google Assistant.

At first I liked the phone, but the more I used it the more frustrated I became. I spend a lot of time on conference calls so the phone functionality is very important. The phone functionality is so 'sub-par' compared to Samsung or Blackberry (yes Blackberry), if I was Google I would be embarrassed. Basics like muting and unmuting calls and still having access to the keypad -- not possible. The bluetooth is frustrating how it connects to one device and not another and doesn't default to the wired headset when plugged in. How is prioritizes or selects connections is frustrating (to say the least)! Basic functionality of the phone is not up to the level of what a Samsung was years ago. Seriously this device is a disappointment, especially given the hype and the price! The camera does take great pictures. I like the size of the XL and it is a durable device.

Constant glitches, messaging and phone calls stop working randomly; super inconsistent reliability that has NOTHING to do with service or network; pure phone. Finally, after hours with support, and 'safe mode' and 'factory resets,' (what a pain!) they told me to send the phone away (thank goodness I had my old phone to use while it was gone!) and wait for a refurbished one. Well, got the refurbished one, and this one is the same way. For example, I'll google a restaurant I want to call, and hit ""call,"" and it freezes, blacks out the screen, then won't allow me to open the phone app at all. Like, literally can't make a phone call for an hour or so until it randomly decides to work again. Ummm, isn't that a BASIC function for a phone? To make phone calls? HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.

I would say 90% of the time I can successfully watch the video on the Pixel XL, where it was less than 20% on the Samsungs. Same Verizon network, same locations in Huntington and Plainview NY. * Battery Life blows away the Samsung S6, somewhat better than Note 7 * USB C charger cord (inserts both ways) makes it easy to plug in power in dark places (Dont need to know which end is up) * Far better speaker than the Galaxy S6 or Note 7. No matter what angle you place the phone in front of you, the speaker is loud and clear * New OS, I like the built in silence mode that you can choose how long the phone needs to be quite for, and then it automatically will go back to normal CONS of Pixel XL * Samsung's UI is better overall, but I got use to the changes except I miss that the Samsung Notification UI that is far far better. It is less cluttered, easier to understand how many messages, voice mails, etc. are pending for me. This is important to me because I have a mix of whats app, sms, emails, and voice mails. I am struggling with this on my PixelXL * Note 7 introduced a terrific capability to juggle multiple bluetooth sources so that my bluetooth earpiece and bluetooth car stereo/phone played together well / were easy to select between on the Note 7 - gosh I miss this. * Not Waterproof - I suspect I enjoy better speaker performance because this isn't waterproof. * No Wireless charging * Finger print scanner is under phone, which means you have to pick it up to unlock it. * The encryption felt more secure on the Samsung. I get to choose the encryption key, there is an entirely different password that must be entered whenever the device is booted, 10 bad attempts erases the phone. Verizon claims the Google Pixel is just as good, just different. I don't know, I am having a hard time believing this. * IT bears repeating ... the Notifications aspects of the Pixel XL is very poor.

B01LY3OB8D,R. A. Dumas,3,"November 28, 2016",False,Not quite ready for prime time....,"Bought from Google but returned it and here's why: 1) Email: I use an exchange account and an office 365 account, and couldn't get both to sync with the native calendar and contacts, without installing three different programs. Other than phone calls, emails and calendaring are the most important functions to me and I needed it to be more seamless than what the Pixel allowed. Other Android phones (Sony, Samsung) offer an email app that has already worked out of the box. 2) Every now and then, the ringer would just stop. I'd have to reboot to get it to kick in again. 3) The kicker for me was when I used Google maps in the car and only got every other word of the command because the phone was crapping in and out. It seemed to me that Google maps should work well on a Google phone. But no. 4) Really poor battery life. 5) Phone call quality was subpar, and in some cases, there was a noticeable buzzing noise - almost like interference - during calls. This happened regularly. I wanted to love this phone and in fact thought the finger print reader on the back was great - one of the fastest I've used. Photos were also very good, although not so much better than other phones to make up for all of the Pixel's quirks.

B01LY3OB8D,Milo Minderbinder,2,"December 18, 2016",False,Good device is you don't mind WORST INTERFACE EVER,"Good device is you don't mind WORST INTERFACE EVER! This Google's creation is literally a schizophrenic monster born of a fevered dreams of re-design EVERYTHING conventional (see: established as a reasonable working smart phone behavior and UI) - It's literally a monocycle with a square wheel – Regular smart phone design and the part of back-end technology that suppose to do back-end things works fine ... BUT– that's where the good part ENDS. For all those who ever owned a nice working droid - designed in say.. Motorola standards this is like looking at a phone designed by someone who only once heard a smart phone described to them (possibly in a foreign language) and are not really clear on the idea of WHY would you need it in the first place. Seriously - it's a usability NIGHTMARE! 1. The regular updates (that you are not aware of) are constantly re-arranging menus. Yesterday my key-board was hiding the paragraph return button behind the Add Emoji option (obvious choice to begin with when you are looking for a 'return' option). Today it's been moved and now hiding as an option for capitalizing a letter. Totally intuitive options in both cases from obviously extensive usability testing trials. 2. Fie Sharing - Plugging your Pixel into computer will not let you see files (like normal Androids use to). Now you have to download Android transfer - which .... DOES NOTHING. It Will tell you that you may be not able to connect to anything because your screen is locked - which it isn't. The complete lack of any preferences or options with suggestions on HOW to fix it, adds extra delight to figuring this out. 3. Camera - great quality ... nice options to adjust the picture - all in (surprisingly) in one place ... except the Save function. Which is on top pf the screen - elegantly blending with the photo - while all the menus are still highly visible as menus - on the bottom. 4. Photo storage - Yes it's broken down into albums but you will need some time to figure out the logic behind how those are structures or how much glue the UI designers had to sniff before coming up with the final logic. Still - if you find what you are looking for it may not be there a few days later when the updates been sent out. 5. Sending a text ... A special adventure if you are using it from your addresses. Because while you can find the recipient - it's completely UNclear as to HOW or Where to enter the text. There is actually a number of arrows you need to try before you are allowed to see the text field. Should you need to do this in a hurry - you are out of luck. Adding another person to the text message can only be done Before you start typing it. Sharing a message may be an option but first you will need to figure out HOW to find a person you are sharing it with - the choice of persons given can be random and it is not clear HOW to find the one you need. It may be hidden behind a map icon or just not available at all. Those are just Immediate pleasure I have encountered in the first few weeks of owning this wonder. And I LOVE Androids.

B01LY3OB8D,Mike,1,"December 24, 2016",True,A short review- just like the amount of time I was able to tolerate with the phone.,"I experienced an issue where my order got lost in transit and I had to go retrieve it. It was the strangest thing. Apart from that, here is a review on the device itself: It's basically like how all the YouTube reviews claim it to be. Excellent battery life. Quick and snappy performance. Visually ugly industrial design (I had to get a case for it that made it slightly more bearable to look at and hold). OS support for at least the next two years. Cloud integration, etc. The be-all and end-all to this phone was the highly-touted camera. Google has the gall to market the Pixel line as the best in its class- compared to any smartphone available on the market. In a day and age where smartphones are replacing point-and-shoots, this is a very important thing to consider. Nearly all my photographs had a noticeable halo at the opposite corner of where a light source would shine. The end result is something unusable. I have no doubt in my mind that this was a physical design fault. Google released a statement saying that they'll incorporate a software fix for this issue, but you can't fix that issue in real-time when shooting a video. Internet keyboard warriors suggest you take a photograph facing away from a light source. I'm the type of person that like to capture moments quickly before the opportunity goes away. I won't have the luxury of framing subjects facing away from a light source most of the time. RIP candid shots. I returned the device because of all the issues I came across just trying to get my hands on the phone, just to find out that one of the key selling points of the phone was garbage.

I was within the return period so I sent it back for a full refund and set out to find another replacement. I was leery of getting another refurbished but I came across the listing for an ""unlocked"" Pixel XL that Abe's had listed. It was just slightly more expensive than the one I returned but much to my surprise, the one I received was BRAND NEW in a sealed Original Google Pixel box with all the cables and documents - which my original refurb did not come with. Everything works great and the whole process of restoring my content from my original Pixel XL to my new one was painless due to the built in backup process that the Pixels have. So, even for an older phone, the Pixel XL is still a great phone. Battery life is stellar, and seems to have improved with the latest version of android ""Pie"". Features are great and the camera is still better than most. I had a LG V20 on Verizon but switched to Project Fi, so it wouldn't work. It had a great camera and some really impressive multimedia features but I really don't miss them with the Pixel. Battery life on the pixel far surpasses that of the V20.

B01LY3OB8D,Concerned Citizen,5,"August 24, 2019",True,"Buy the Model Manufactured On or After January, 2017","I had done much research on this phone, and my conclusion was torn - people either loved it or hated it! I didn't want to end up as one of the latter. I'm happy to say that, at least after almost two months of use, I am very happily one of the former. After reading, on Amazon, many reviews of this phone, I came across one that seemed, to me, the likely pivot-point in deciding into which of the two said camps one would fall -- the manufacture-date. That review (I don't have a link, but it's there if you search) stated that Google had actually lost a class-action lawsuit on these phones (Google Pixel/XL, at least 1st generation), BUT ONLY IF IT WAS MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO JANUARY, 2017!!! It, or another review, also laid out the decryption-key of the device's serial number, the important digits being the third and fourth; the third being the year from 2010 in which the device was manufactured (e..g 7 indicates 2017), and the fourth being the month (e.g. 1 indicates January). So, I figured that I would buy one (two actually - one for my wife, also) and immediately return the device(s) if the third and fourth digits of the serial number were not, respectively, at least 7 (for 2017) and 1 (for January). I'm happy to write that seller Abe's of Maine (or its current derivation) gave me two that exceeded that month by several (75 and 76). So, I kept the device(s) and am darn happy I did! They perform exceptionally, and are the best smartphones my wife and I have ever owned (I'll leave the particulars to all the other supportive reviews, as there are many).",1.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver)

After noticing the Zenfones GPS was starting to have issues connecting and Waze was showing me driving in the woods I figured it was time get back to as pure Android as I could, the answer was obvious, Pixel! I was looking at a Pixel 2 XL but the first gen Pixel still has its headphone jack and best of all, free original quality storage on Google Photos for life! Once you use the camera you will see why the free life storage is valuable. The first gen pixel just received its final security update from Google but the apps are still being updated. The Pixel has the ""Night Sight"" like the Pixel 4 even though the processing is done in software instead of the 4s neural net.

Upon arrival, I opened the shipping box, and pulled out the glorious white Google Pixel XL with 128GB box. The tape on the sides was already split. There my OCD was disappointed, but I was also irritated because clearly, someone opened it before it was sent to me. Now. I went through the set up, everything was smooth, even downloaded my wallpaper from my old phone. I was impressed! The photos were just incredible. I was stoked! Then. Someone sent me an MMS message. And it WOULD NOT download... And when I went to send one from my phone to a friend, the MMS would never go through. I also noticed that during the time that I had it, it would get very hot when charging. And would also get hot when in use for 10 minutes or more. And yes, I was using -THE- charger that came in the box with the phone. I contacted Google. But they were no help, as I had purchased through Amazon... Maybe you will have better luck than me. But this was my second return of this phone to Amazon as the first purchase was refurbished. Heck, by the time I finish finding the perfect phone for myself, I probably could have just bought a brand spanking new one from Google themselves for the amazingly robbing price of $900 with all the return shipping fees I'm paying.",5.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver)
B01LY3OB8D,George P.,5,"February 9, 2017",True,A phone that will set milestones to the others.,"Amazing phone by Google's first attempt to creating a phone from start. HTC built these phones but Google designed and over looked the whole process. I'm a avid Samsung user for the past 7 years and wanted to get my teeth into something different. Not only that, but also wanted to be apart of yet another technical milestone this phone will create. Upping the game for all other manufacturers to do better. Pros and cons on the phone. Pros: Material is metal and Gorilla Glass 4. Not glass covered so their is some texture so the phone won't fly out of your hands if not in a case. Super fast! This phone is quick, fastest processor in the market now for smart phones. Very silky performance. Runs like a Samsung 7 when animation is turned off. If you get the XL, battery life is amazing. The XL comes with a bigger battery and screen of course. We will see how long it lasts, but for now does not get hot at all, and battery life definitely runs over the 8 hour work day with heavy usage. Works flawlessly with Google Play apps, and Google hardware. Chromecast Ultra is awesome with that device, and I'm excited to match this up with Google Home in the near future. Google Assistant is honestly the best verbal command app I've ever seen. Very responsive,and you do not need to speak to it like it is a robot. Can figure out what you want even though you may get a little tongue tide and give a few extra ""ummms"" and 'aaaa's"" she will still pretty much get you to where your going. Kind of a pro and con. You will have to switch all your cords to the USB C connector. Finally did away with the Mini USB that constantly break all the time. Camera is the best I've seen in any phone. Front and back. Stabilisation makes your movies look professional quality. Unlock button at the rear of the phone, placed where your index finger naturally resides is awesome. Fingerprint scanner is super quick and accurate. Cons: No expandable memory. Highly recommend getting the 128gig. Although when you purchase the phone you have access to the Google Cloud service and can save all your HD and 4k media unlimited. Kinda helps the memory. Not water and dust proof. Never a fan of getting my equipment wet regardless if it is OK too, but nice to have just in case. Expensive as hell! Coming in at the same price as the other big two, but is only with one carrier currently Verizon wireless. Hopefully that will change soon because this phone deserves a unlimited plan. Verizon does not offer, but it's easier to afford financing through a data plan. The pro to this when you purchase a US unlocked phone your avoiding all the BS bloatware from service providers.",11.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display ( Factory Unlocked US Version ) (Very Silver)

(and the most expensive) Mine is brand new so cost more than this one factory unlocked. The assistant, which is why I bought it, does not work dependably at all. She does what she wants to when she wants to, or does nothing at all. I cannot unlock it with my voice, so IT IS NOT HANDS FREE AT ALL!! And that is why I bought it. I was told I could unlock it with my voice if I had no free hands, and it works for an hour or so and then I have to manually put in the code again to unlock it. I have been back to Verizon several times, and they tell me they have fixed the problem, and it will work for a couple hours and then I have to manually put in the code again. I am used to the Amazon Echo, which I LOVE, but this Google assistant is a pain in the neck and almost totally unresponsive. Nothing is easy to find and nothing is easy to do. Every small task involves constant searching and attempts to complete. I hate the interface!! It makes my life a misery, and I love tech, so it is not me. the problems are too numerous to even list. I have had it several months now, and cannot return it, because I wasted the time having the Verizon people try and solve the many problems, which did NOT STAY FIXED for very long each time. Turning the darned thing on is a major problem from the sleep mode. IT IS SO OVERPRICED it is absurd!!! And I am stuck with the darned thing. BE WARNED. it is very expensive garbage.

B01LY3OB8D,Joe Smart,1,"May 9, 2017",False,Disappointing,"This may be the worst premium phone ever made. On the first hot Summer day in Chicago, the phone overheated and shut down three separate times. I contacted Google support and they claimed there wasn't anything wrong with my phone and e-mailed a list of what they consider legitimate (meaning the warranty doesn't apply) reasons why this might happen on the Pixel XL. I've had 100.00 phones and 300.00 phones and 500.00 phones and a 600.00 phone but before the Pixel XL, I never owned a phone that repeatedly shut down because I used the GPS on a hot day. The phone reception is pretty lousy compared with other phones that I've owned. The speakers sound tinny. The battery life is disappointing. The battery runs hot (90-100F) when the phone is idle and sitting in an air-conditioned room. Pixel support is useless. The Pixel XL is at best a 300.00 phone marked up obscenely with a build quality that is obviously lousy compared to genuine premium phones. If you buy one of these things you will probably regret it. This is the response I got when I complained about the phone overheating and shutting down: Hi Joe, Thanks for contacting Google Support! This email is in regards to the chat conversation we are having right now, as discussed, once you roll back to Nougat update, please follow the recommendations below if the issue persists. Your device may warm up with use. Letting the device ‘take a break’ from use or limiting/turning off features (even those running in the background) could remedy the situation. Here are some tips/suggestions: Media apps (music, video games) 1) Close or turn off other apps and features that you're not using; they may be running in the background. 2) Discontinue using the media temporarily until the temperature normalizes. User-installed apps 1) Put the device in safe-mode to disable 3rd party apps and see if the issue improves. 2) Try uninstalling recently installed apps to pinpoint the app causing the issue. Display brightness 1) Manually setting the brightness to be very bright may contribute to higher device temperature. 2) Consider setting to auto brightness to manually reducing the brightness setting. GPS / 3G / WiFi - prolonged data connectivity 1) Turn off feature when not in use. 2) Stop or limit use and allow device to cool down if it gets warm. Exposure to direct heat 1) Remove from heat and keep away from direct heat or excessive sunlight. Poor ventilation 1) Expose the device rather than keeping it tucked away in poor ventilated/tight areas (layers, small pockets, bags). Cases 1) Don't use a case that covers the front and back of the device. 2) Use official case (available on Google Store in some countries). Chargers 1) Don't use unofficial chargers which can overcharge and degrade the battery. 2) Use official charger (available on Google Store in some countries). Daydream View 1) Daydream View requires high performance from the device. The device's temperature should stay within safe limits. 2) Remove any protective cases from the device to improve thermal ventilation. 3) If your device feels too hot, stop using Daydream View and allow the device to cool down. Android Wear 1) Power off the device for 5-10 minutes and turn it on again. 2) Try using the watch for another day to see if your issue improves. If your watch is still warm after a day, reply to this email and let us know.

I like what I like and didn't want to spend $1000 on a new phone or get locked into a contract and payment plan. This was the best compromise I could think of, despite the risk of buying third party. The Pixel is surprisingly similar to the Nexus models, which I was very pleased about. I was only surprised because this was Google's entry into the luxury phone market. It retains the best parts of the Nexus phones (clean OS, practical design, etc.) while adding design improvements (great camera, fingerprint reader, better picture and sound, etc.). Overall, a great phone. Note: There is no warranty with this phone, as others have pointed out. The only way to get a warranty is to purchase through Google or a carrier.

B01M01YX15,Leavened,3,"April 30, 2019",True,Google Pixel 2016 Has a Known Microphone Issue - Buyer Beware,"I purchased a used Google Pixel (2016 model) in March 2019 after damaging my old phone and hoping to tide myself over until I paid all the installments on the old phone. I'd heard good things about the Pixel and found a used model for a good price here on Amazon. I got the phone on time and in one piece, with an included after market charger as promised. The phone's condition was described accurately - a few minor scratches on the case but no screen cracks and no apparent problems. However, after a few days of use the problems started to appear. The first time I tried to make a phone call on the phone, I discovered there was a serious problem. The phone's microphone was not working during phone calls or at any time. When this bug presented itself, it completely crashed the ""Phone"" app and I could not even hear the person on the other end of the line. After some research, I found out that this was a known problem with 2016 Google Pixels. There are some known issues where the phone will sometimes think you have a bluetooth headset paired to it when you really don't and just in general hardware and software issues with the microphone. You can find these issue by simply Googling ""2016 Pixel Microphone."" Phone calls worked just fine so long as I had a bluetooth headset paired, but if I wanted to talk directly on the phone it would only work if I restarted the phone and kept bluetooth disabled and even then it only worked about 1 out of 3 times. Amazon asked for a few specific features to be reviewed. The fingerprint reader worked perfectly. It picked up my index finger without issue. No issues with this feature. The battery life was very poor, even for a used phone. I could only get through about 8-9 hours away from a charger before the phone would die. It would also unexpectedly shut off with 10-15% charge remaining. Though, I should say it was unexpected when the phone didn't die until it got down below 5% because it almost always shut down somewhere between 10 and 20% charge remaining. Even with battery saver mode permanently enabled, the phone could barely get through a work day. Battery life is going to be hit or miss with a used device so I give it some leeway, but this Pixel's battery was significantly worse than any smartphone I've ever had even after years of use. Overall, the phone was a decent value for the money. I got it at a good price here on Amazon ($100) and when it was holding a charge, the phone worked well aside from the ""Phone"" app. I probably would have kept it in spite of its faults except that it failed to allow me to take calls from my wife a few too many times.

B01M01YX15,Ric,2,"November 6, 2018",True,Mixed bag - phone GREAT but can't recommend seller,"Phone 99% perfect, but the 1% was a truly significant hurdle. Phone arrived without Sim card tray. Didn't realize until went to Verizon to buy Sim card/activate phone. Amazon Chat rep found sim tray from another seller. Once I ordered it, Amazon reimbursed cost. Arrived 2 days later, fit perfectly, and was able to finally activate phone, so I am out no money, but it was not a good experience. Phone itself - once activated, it's been perfect. Great value for those of us who don't ""have"" to have the absolutely latest $1,000 phone, but want a great phone. Fast, sleek, not loaded with bloatware, great camera. Data transfer from old phone didn't work the first time, but the phone's transfer interface showed me that texts and pics didn't transfer so I ran the routine again and everything transferred. I was worried about reviews about screen cracking easily and can see how that can happen, so I ordered a Pixel Google case at the same time ($5.90) and it seems to have enough of a lip to adequately protect the screen from most drops.

I loved the battery life, the photo quality, everything! I would have recommended the Pixel to anyone! But now, only 1.5 years later, the battery life is honestly the worst of any phone I have ever had. Period. The battery drops from 100% to 90% after just 5 minutes of screentime-- draining constantly. If I try to take a picture while I am at 50% or less-- it just shuts off and auto-plummets to 0%. This makes is super unreliable. I have read many reviews on other websites where people with a first generation pixel are struggling with the same thing. Basically ever since the 2 updates ago, the phone has been basically impossible to use without carrying a portable charger everywhere. I would not recommend this. Save your money and buy a phone that will last longer. Note: I use it with Google's Project Fi service too, so it isn't even a carrier issue.

It would shut down randomly, the screen would freeze and I had trouble restarting, the headphone jack wouldn't work, calls would take extended periods of time to connect and then the calls would randomly drop, sometimes I was able to make calls/text but I wasn't receiving incoming calls/texts. I had to restart my phone several a day to resolve these issues. The only way I knew that I wasn't receiving calls/texts is when I would restart my phone and 40+ texts and voicemails would pop up. That was a huge problem for me because I am on-call and use my cell phone to take emergency calls. Fortunately nothing critical happened while my phone was done, but it did cause a bit of a problem.

If you do, I HIGHLY recommend getting a protection plan that covers software issues and will replace phone. You may not have issues right away, but there's a good chance you will down the line, especially after Android OS updates. Android 9 update (most recent one) crashed my phone and made it completely unusable. I bought this phone direct from Google and I hate it so much that I needed to leave an Amazon review for it. Worst Android phone I've ever had, bar none. When I first got the phone I had issues with MMS messaging which I thought was an unlocked phone issue with my carrier but after further researching it and contacting Google, it was an issue that happened no matter the cell service provider. It took about 6mo for this to be resolved from Google with updates/bug fixes. Then the reboot loops started after one of the Android OS updates. After doing some research, this seems to be a common issue with Pixel 1's and other Google-supported phones. Boot loops happened after subsequent Android updates, I've had to factory reset it twice. Now after the most recent update (Android 9) there were System UI Failures I can no longer make calls due to this critical software issue that seems to be a fairly common issue based on threads on Google support. There is no fix for this as factory reset did not resolve the issue. I called Google support and they basically told me that I had to get a new phone or replace the motherboard (which costs almost as much as a new phone). Don't get me wrong. When this phone works, it works phenomenally. Lightning fast, fantastic camera, and it handles multiple apps open and running at once better than any other Android I've had. But I've had so many critical issues with it and I'm definitely not alone on that. Purchase with caution.",,Google,"Google Pixel Phone - 5 inch display (Factory Unlocked US Version) (32GB, Quite Black)"
B01M01YX15,seattle crone,3,"August 6, 2018",False,"Like new, as advertised - but experiencing problems 5 months in","I ordered the pixel 5 inch and it arrived in truly ""like new"" condition as the seller promised. There were some tiny (nearly invisible) scratches on the mirrored black part on the top third of the back of the phone, but really nothing to quibble about. I was very relieved about that. Plus it was 2/3rds of the price of a new one, so well worth it imo. I've had it over a month and am very pleased with it. I do notice that when I run, say, Google Maps, open on-screen for an hour while navigating in 70+ degree whether, the battery gets noticeably hot. But not enough to overly concern me (although it does worry me a little). The battery life isn't quite what I expected - by the end of the day it's generally down to 20% or lower, which I'm not used to. But I haven't yet had it go dead on me, and I do usually spend several hours an evening reading on it, so perhaps it's not so bad. It does charge back up quickly. Now the things that really annoyed me: as a refurbished phone, I expected it to come in a generic box, with a generic charger. And it did (btw, the charger is different from a standard Android phone, so you'll probably want to order an extra). And it even had instructions. But in the instructions, it told me that I should use the ""included tool"" to open the SIM slot. There was no such tool. Fortunately, upon examination, it's one of those pinholes that you can open with the end of a paper clip (I used the back of my earring) so that wasn't the end of the world. the instructions also told me to use the quick-change phone-to-phone connector (I don't remember if it was called quick-change, but essentially it would allow me to physically connect, via a cable, my old phone to my new phone, and transfer everything over). No such tool was included. Again, fortunately, they had an option for doing the same thing via the cloud, and it wasn't terribly hard, but still. Be aware that you are not going to receive the full suite of accessories a new phone comes with. However, despite those (rather minor) inconveniences, I'm very happy with my new phone. I was a bit concerned after reading so many negative reviews. Since some reviewers say that it really depends on which third-party supplier it was, I'll mention that mine came from Edge Cellular. Overall, I think I got a real deal. It was particularly important to me to get a 5"" phone because I just really don't like the oversized phones, and I researched all the various brands' 5"" models carefully before settling on the Pixel. It performs well: fast, light, easy to use, plenty of storage. UPDATE DECEMBER 10th: I'm having problems with the microphone. Apparently this has happened with many Pixels. At first I had a few calls where they couldn't hear my on the other end but I could record audio, dictate, and voice search fine. A couple of weeks after that the microphone wasn't registering at all. Now I have to speak loudly directly into the microphone (bottom of phone by charger) in order to dictate or record, and use speaker on calls. And of course there is no warranty support. I will probably have to replace this phone shortly :(",,Google,"Google Pixel Phone - 5 inch display (Factory Unlocked US Version) (32GB, Quite Black)"

I purchased Google Pixel XL last year around this time. They pushed Android 9 (PI) on it couple of weeks ago and the phone died on me. It wont turn ON (not even the boot loader with Power + Volume Down). Google denied to help fix this issue (as the warranty ended just last month) and instead asked me to take it for repair at uBreakiFix. They told me that they have few other phones with same issue. In order to fix it they told me to replace the mother-board - which is $400. Had this been an issue due to my fault, I would have moved on; but this is Google's strategy I think to mess up people's phone by pushing untested and unreliable android upgrades and make them buy protection plan. I am surprised that Google has done such a bad job with testing their new version of android prior to releasing it. I was a big fan of Google until now (was planning on buying their products for smart home). NOT ANYMORE. I am going to stay away from google products and would recommend everyone to do the same. I would suggest: 1. DO NOT TRUST Google Android Upgrades. 2.

B01M01YX15,Nadia,1,"July 27, 2018",False,"3 years, 3 Pixel 1 phones, 4 different hardware failures","I bought this phone NEW from Google about 2 years ago. The first phone I got developed a headphone jack issue only 2 months from purchase date where intermittently sound would not come through the headphone jack. I would have to restart the phone (sometimes multiple times) to make the headphone jack work again. On one occasion it did not want to start up for half an hour. The replacement phone Google got me was a refurbished phone. This phone had no visible defects or scratches, no software issues, and it worked well, (for about 1.5 years) until this week, when it started boot looping. I took it to a repair shop where it was looked at by an android specialist. It was not a power switch issue. It was not a firmware reprogramming issue. The jist is many components need to be replaced, but getting those components is difficult, and they are uncertain if it will fix the issue as the motherboard itself may be broken. Their recommendation is to buy a new phone instead. Very disappointing! I have never had any other phone break in the past (Samsung Galaxy S4 or the Motorola flip phone)! This one broke twice! Pros of the Pixel: Fast, no lag, no freezing, seamless experience. Excellent camera quality (better than samsung galaxy s9). I actually really like the phone, when it doesn't break. Cons of the Pixel: For the original $600 price don't expect the phone to work for more than 2 years. Maybe not even a few months. I suspect the same is true for the $300 price as well. Or any price. New updates: In another year, I have had the Pixel 1 phone break two more times. I got a refurbished Pixel 1 for $80 which was great but then after a year it also started bootlooping. When I took the now 2 bootlooping Pixel 1 phones to another repair shop, they managed to repair the old one (the refurbished one from Google). The new one they said had a busted motherboard which could be replaced for $300.

This Google's creation is literally a schizophrenic monster born of a fevered dreams of re-design EVERYTHING conventional (see: established as a reasonable working smart phone behavior and UI) - It's literally a monocycle with a square wheel – Regular smart phone design and the part of back-end technology that suppose to do back-end things works fine ... BUT– that's where the good part ENDS. For all those who ever owned a nice working droid - designed in say.. Motorola standards this is like looking at a phone designed by someone who only once heard a smart phone described to them (possibly in a foreign language) and are not really clear on the idea of WHY would you need it in the first place. Seriously - it's a usability NIGHTMARE! 1. The regular updates (that you are not aware of) are constantly re-arranging menus. Yesterday my key-board was hiding the paragraph return button behind the Add Emoji option (obvious choice to begin with when you are looking for a 'return' option). Today it's been moved and now hiding as an option for capitalizing a letter. Totally intuitive options in both cases from obviously extensive usability testing trials. 2. Fie Sharing - Plugging your Pixel into computer will not let you see files (like normal Androids use to). Now you have to download Android transfer - which .... DOES NOTHING. It Will tell you that you may be not able to connect to anything because your screen is locked - which it isn't. The complete lack of any preferences or options with suggestions on HOW to fix it, adds extra delight to figuring this out. 3. Camera - great quality ... nice options to adjust the picture - all in (surprisingly) in one place ... except the Save function. Which is on top pf the screen - elegantly blending with the photo - while all the menus are still highly visible as menus - on the bottom. 4. Photo storage - Yes it's broken down into albums but you will need some time to figure out the logic behind how those are structures or how much glue the UI designers had to sniff before coming up with the final logic. Still - if you find what you are looking for it may not be there a few days later when the updates been sent out. 5. Sending a text ... A special adventure if you are using it from your addresses. Because while you can find the recipient - it's completely UNclear as to HOW or Where to enter the text. There is actually a number of arrows you need to try before you are allowed to see the text field. Should you need to do this in a hurry - you are out of luck. Adding another person to the text message can only be done Before you start typing it. Sharing a message may be an option but first you will need to figure out HOW to find a person you are sharing it with - the choice of persons given can be random and it is not clear HOW to find the one you need. It may be hidden behind a map icon or just not available at all. Those are just Immediate pleasure I have encountered in the first few weeks of owning this wonder. And I LOVE Androids.

However, Google refuses to replace your phone with a new phone, only refurbished ones. Google has also had a reputation of knowingly selling bad refurbished phones. So in a span of less than 8 months, I've had 3 Pixels - 2 of which are refurbished ones. My current one is having similar symptoms to my 2nd pixel again. It'll randomly reboot for no reason, and sometimes the mic or audio won't be working at all. I'm disappointed. I might not even bother with contacting Google again this time around.

B01M01YX15,Elizabeth Z,4,"August 17, 2017",False,Set data alerts and limits + monitor apps running in background unless you have unlimited data plan,"Got this for my 20-something daughter at Verizon store very early in July. She still loves, loves, loves it and would give it 5 stars. However, her data usage went from under 2 gigs to over 7 the first month she used it because of default settings allowing so many apps to run in the background, and because of the phone's reluctance to connect to anything less than optimal, super-perfect wi-fi signals. Correcting this has been easy with a bit of attention and vigilance, and luckily we had increased our family data plan to 8G (rather than scaling back to 4G, as the salesperson said we might based on our historical usage) and had 8G of rollover data (now lost - you can only carry over data for one month with Verizon) that would have protected us last month even if my daughter had actually streamed video and actually used much real data (as opposed to background apps). So all is well -- I will continue to watch reviews and may even consider purchasing this phone when I tire of my old Motorola Droid Maxx. But buyer beware: DO read the instructions and take care about what is running in the background, and about setting data alerts and limits even if you think you don't need them (unless you have unlimited data ... then none of this is an issue).",4.0,Google,"Google Pixel Phone - 5 inch display (Factory Unlocked US Version) (32GB, Quite Black)"

B01M01YX15,Christian Book Reader,3,"March 15, 2017",False,If You Like Windows 10 Phones You are Going to be Disappointed,"I started off with an Android smartphones (HTC, Motorola) early on, and then three years ago purchased a Windows Phone (Lumia Icon). I would have purchased another Windows device after my Icon died, but there are no longer any new Windows smartphones for my service provider, Verizon. So this review is really a comparison between the Pixel and a Windows 10 smartphone. From non-Windows phone users, there is a perception that the Windows 10 phone is a complete dud. I am mostly in agreement when it comes to apps. However, I was mostly able to accomplish everything using the web browser. I expected the Pixel to have a bunch of other wonderful features that I was ""missing"" on my Windows phone. Now, I am finding out that it has lots of apps, but is missing key features from my Windows phone. Cortana worked great in the car. For example, it would read text messages to me via bluetooth, and allow me to reply back with a text. I have yet to find that feature on my Pixel. To get live tile look on the Pixel, it seems you have to load other third party app launchers and other notification apps, and those sometimes will interfere. My Windows phone was quick to set up and I could see all of my live tiles on one page (e.g., text messages, emails, phone calls, weather, news, etc.). With the pixel, the same information is presented in different views/spots. In Windows 10, the live calendar tile and app was nice and simple. The Android calendar widget looks cluttered to me, and I cannot fit everything I want on one page (unlike my Windows phone). I do like the Pixel screen resolution, battery life is great and the camera is nice. I also like the fingerprint security feature. In summary, if you are a Windows phone user, I think you will be disappointed. If you have a service provider that still carries newer Windows phones (e.g, 950), I would suggest sticking with it. If you never used a Windows 10 phone, you will not know the great features you are missing. To Microsoft - Can you please bring to market more Windows phones and figure out the app gap? Note: I purchased this phone directly from Verizon Wireless.",4.0,Google,"Google Pixel Phone - 5 inch display (Factory Unlocked US Version) (32GB, Quite Black)"

B01M01YX15,Forrest S. Morris Jr.,4,"December 17, 2016",False,I have 30 Day's to return it and I'm pretty sure my Note 4 will be home before then,"First off, I wasn't intending buying this or any new phone, but being part of the Note 7 Fiasco not once but twice I broke out my old Note 4 Edge. But alas it was not to be, the repairs Samsung had done just after the first Note 7 BS didn't work and I was lucky to have caught it before the 90 day warranty expiration. Soon to be phoneless as I had to send the Note 4 Back in a timely fashion, I decided to give the Pixel a whirl, I have 30 Day's to return it and I'm pretty sure my Note 4 will be home before then, so why not. Short of it, I settled on the 5 as there are no XL's, unless you want to buy one for 1200+, ha, not!!! It's smaller obviously than my Note's, but it has a reasonable sized screen, smaller than the XL by 1/2 inch or so but still bigger than the I-Phone and close in size to the Samsung S7. What does this phone lack, if 1080P isn't sufficient look elsewhere, lol, I've always been of the impression that yes better resolution is nice, but most of the time this is relative to the screen size, short of it, it's very unlikely you'll ever see the difference between 4K or 1080P or even 720P for that matter on a screen that's maybe 6""s or less. But, this phone like other high end devices does record in 4K for your viewing pleasure on a more substantial Monitor. There is a pixel diff, again it's not likely you'll notice unless seeing that tiny drop of water on a blade of grass is really why you watched the game, or you decide to see how close you can push the phone to your face, maybe just maybe you may notice. So what really matters, well I'm a long time Samsung Fan, maybe toss in a LG/HTC here or there, but Samsung has been my go to for a long time, as apparent as I returned 2 Note 7's. I'll say that yes, Samsung offers up a really nice UI full of Samsung goodies, heart rate monitor, gorgeous handset, lot's of glass, all kinds of software(Bloat), and I like most of it, except the (Bloat). What's the Pixel offer up, a extremely clean version of Android, they say there is some app's, I haven't looked really close, but short of Hacking the phone this may be the cleanest version of Android ever from Verizon. What's this mean, fast, no NO lag, you know how sometimes you flip the screen and sometimes it flips and sometimes it doesn't or sometimes it just sit's and does nothing, that's irritating lag, all those cool and fancy things on the Samsung contribute to that, the phone can lag, apps won't open/close, you push buttons and nothing happens, not so with the Pixel at least not up to now after 3 day's of playing with it. This phone is fast, add in the upgraded processor, which it may seem insignificant, but look up processors and see how much a upgraded latest and greatest Intel is from the less than latest and greatest, making this phone even quicker. As for looks, this is really one of those personal things, subjective, a cell phone is intertwined into much of our lives, so making them personal is how we make it ours. For me, it really doesn't matter what the phone looks like as I'll put some sort of case on it anyway, the front of the phone excepting the large vacant space is standard cell phone look with durable gorilla glass, front and back, I'd say it's nice looking but nothing like the Samsung Note 7. Now for the easy stuff, the fingerprint reader on the back, you know what, that is actually a pretty good place for it, my index finger on my left hand falls on the button when holding the phone, voila it works, I never even bothered to use it on my Note 7's, so in fairness I can't say it's really better or worse, but, in my case it works just fine. The camera is nice, but again, that can be a little subjective as well, perhaps you see to much brightness or I may prefer the sharper image or whatever floats your boat, the camera takes beautiful pic's, so did my Samsung's, it's almost a give in that most good phones take good pic's. Update's, I'm a geek, I like the latest and greatest, if there is a new improved version, I want it, the short of it is, this phone will always get the latest and greatest, no waiting for Samsung to tie the update into their UI or Verizon to meddle with it, this is pure Android from Google, nice to get the operating system free of lot's of BS. So, what's not to like, well no goodies, no monitor on the back by the lens, no fancy integrated software, no plethora of Apps you may or may not like, no Verizon add-ins, not as fancy looking. I think I'm liking this phone, I'm tossed up now, maybe wait for the XL, was going to wait for the Note 8, but this phone intrigues me, and I haven't really tried the Assistant App to speak of, and I'm sure Google will make updating this phone a priority, which means it should get better before the next incarnation. For those confused, there is access to e-mail through Gmail, it's your Pop 3 just not an independent mail box, it's listed as others when adding accounts. There is notifications, turn them on, the basics are all there, all the things to make your phone work appear to be on board, I haven't found any missing parts yet, if there is something you want, more than likely there is a app for it, try MacroDroid for one. As for Bluetooth, I've hooked up my PC, 2 Cars and no issues, sometimes BT can be stubborn and sometimes you need to reset and start over, restart your Phone the car and try again, I've had no dropped calls, and it appears to stay hooked up to my WiFi without issue, not to say it won't just none to date. I'm trying to conclude why 4 stars, I guess because I miss my goodies, but that's not the phones fault, it's what it is, if you buy it you agree that's what you want. It's worth the try, if it doesn't work return it, in the end I may do just that, I got 27 day's to figure it out.",2.0,Google,"Google Pixel Phone - 5 inch display (Factory Unlocked US Version) (32GB, Quite Black)"

It's really quick, of course, and has all of Google's top software features. It was always the design that would make or break it - and in many ways, Google has delivered. By going down the same 18:9 aspect ratio and skinny bezel route as Samsung, Apple, LG et al, Google has ensured the Pixel 2 XL feels as modern as its rivals - and that split glass-and-metal rear that was so divisive a year ago has aged better than a fine wine. Sure, finding room for stereo speakers has made it a bit bulkier than the competition, but it sounds fantastic as a result. If you don’t mind the size, and spending the extra, the XL is absolutely the Pixel 2 to buy - the smaller version just feels plain in comparison. It's expensive, but then what flagship phone isn't these days? Google didn’t quite manage it last year, but with the best hardware powering the best version of Android you'll find on any phone, anywhere, the Pixel 2 XL finally feels like the full package. Is it the best Android phone around? Not quite. The Galaxy S8 - and indeed the bigger S8+ - still just about pips it based on its sheer desirability, and comes a close second with camera quality. The XL easily slots in behind it, though.

B01M0PADR4,Eduardo,5,"November 26, 2016",False,The best ANDROID Phone. Period.,"Pros Fastest device ever. Killer Camera Stock Android (Mostly) Beautiful Screen Excellent Build Quality Beautiful (if polarizing) Design Best phone quality Cons Price Some features missing Not Officially Water Resistant Should you buy: Yes! Actual Value: $660 Google has done something amazing. It has gone from the company with the discreet Nexus line to a phone that is literally everywhere. I remember when no one would bat an eye, much less be impressed, from my past Nexus. But this phone has gotten the compliments of everyone it meets. I know that this phone has pretty much divided the Android community and abandoned its budget roots. But if this is the foundation of what is to come, then Google is on a fast track to be the best smartphone. -Design- Beautiful. In one word, this phone is beautiful. I have the very silver model with a white front and rear glass and a light aluminum frame. Now I know a lot of people have given this phone trash talk because it looks like an iPhone. But unless you hold one in your hand, you can’t appreciate the small details that Google has put in their design. The phone is not super slim, but the round borders make it really comfortable to hold in my hand. It is light and balanced with a giant glass window in the rear. I personally like it. It gives it a distinct design that can’t be accused of copying Apple. The is a simple G branding that isn’t as pronounced as the Apple logo, but it is there. The entire construction feels solid with buttons that click with just the right amount of force and no wobbling of any kind. It gives a premium feel that makes it feel as good as the price suggest. Gorilla Glass 4 protects the front of the phone, but the rear glass is something that I’m not sure. It feels the same, but I haven’t confirmed it. -Performance- Okay let’s cut to the chase. This phone is fast. Really fast. Blistering fast. Sure, benchmarks show that the iPhone’s A10 leaves everyone in the dust. But in real world usage, there is no lag. At all. The Snapdragon 821 is the latest and greatest from Qualcomm and it can handle pretty much everything. It can multitask with split screen and it works flawlessly. The phone doesn’t stutter, even with YouTube open on both the app and Chrome (why you would want to do that is another question). I did write most of this review on my Pixel while watching videos, so it definitely has the horsepower. The 4GB of RAM and extremely fast UFS 2.0 storage keeps it running quickly and responsive. There really seems to be no bottlenecks on this phone and that is really impressive. -Software- Android 7.1 comes with the Pixel with the stock experience polished a bit. The launcher is simple and functional and while the round icons might turn off some people, the design is at least consistent going app to app. The UI is extremely simple to use and extremely responsive. But the main feature that is included with the phone is the Google Assistant. She is always alert and ready to respond when saying “Ok Google”. So how useful is she? Very. Think of it as a pocket Alexa with a bit more personality. Asking it any question provides a solid response and gives you the answer directly. Other functions like timer and reminders work flawlessly and almost never fails. Add the voice recognition to it and it is great. Is it perfect? Alas, no. Some questions it can’t find the answer to and it can’t control your smarthome things just yet. It has potential, but it still needs work before it becomes a perfect assistant. -Display- AMOLED screens are technically the best displays available right now (the “technically” is another rant for another time), though Apple has proven that you can get a best in class display using LCD. So how does this look? Well, beautiful. 1080p might not be the highest resolution available, but at 441 pixels per inch, the pixels are virtually indistinguishable. This is compared to the iPhone 7, which has a rather modest 324 pixels per inch. Both are great displays, but the Pixel looks better to my eyes than the iPhone. The contrast is extremely good and colors pop with a slight increase in saturation. The iPhone is technically color accurate and the Samsung S7 is a little more punchier with the color saturation. But the Pixel lands right in the middle and the result is something I rather like. Brightness is very good and is easily readable on both harsh lighting and the blazing sun of California. -Camera- One area where it isn't in the middle is in the camera. But my god is this camera good. The 12.3 MP shooter is paired with a 2.0 aperture lens with PDAF and laser autofocus; but no OIS. But hold on! Before you decide to write off the phone as something that is less than the S7 and iPhone 7, there is something you have to know. It doesn’t matter. Most cameras can get really good photos in great lighting. But the Pixel gets really good colors and great white balance. The details it gets in the images are great and it even gives some great depth of field. But where it really shines is in low light. With barely any light, the camera manages to focus, get some detail, and light up the photos. It just manages to get a great shot every time. The video is also silky smooth with EIS managing to keep everything stable. Is it perfect? Nope. The autofocus is a bit finicky at times and OIS would make this amazing camera setup even better, particularly where longer exposure is needed to get a better shot. But overall, it can hang with the best phones this year. -CONTROVERSY (Personal rant)- Okay. Let’s address the elephant in the room. The price. Now I was a longtime Nexus fan and I have used the 5, 6, and the 5X and the thing I always loved was that it delivered near flagship specs at a great price. It was also the only way to use the latest and greatest that Android could offer. But the Nexus was never the best phone out there. The 5 had terrible battery life, the 6 was too large and too expensive and both had terrible cameras. The 5X and 6P came closest to delivering the ultimate smartphone. The Pixel follows a completely different philosophy. The Pixel is the culmination of what Google can do without a budget restriction; what it can do to make the perfect phone. This Pixel does not fall short in the components department. It is using the best processor, display, material, build quality, and batteries that it has access to. I was a bit bummed that the Pixel’s price wasn’t lower. But if Google wanted to compete head to head with the iPhone, it had to sacrifice its budget market. But in a way, the Nexus line succeeded with its mission. Back when the Nexus 5 was released, there were no budget phones that carried flagship specs at an affordable price. And sure, the Nexus had its faults. But it, along with Motorola, showed the world that it is possible to have a great experience on Android without spending a lot. Now, in 2016, the Nexus doesn’t really have a place to be. There are a number of options ready to address the budget segment of the market. There is: OnePlus One Axon 7 Motorola G4 Plus ASUS Zenfone 3 Alcatel Idol 4S Moto Z Play Honor 8 Where does the Nexus fit in? Honestly, I'm not so sure. None of these phones are perfect. But they more than deliver on the best value per dollar. The only place left to go is the ultra affordable market (which is currently owned by Blu) and the premium market. Considering the lack of progress in that market, I think Google is the right company to go and change that (although it is coming to butt heads with Samsung). So I do understand the frustration that the Nexus fans must be feeling right now. But I also know that they are covered more than ever before. To put it bluntly, stop hating on the Pixel for what it isn’t and appreciate it for what it is. -Conclusion- This phone is not perfect. The Samsung Galaxy S7 has the most features available everywhere and the iPhone just has that premium feel that no other phone can provide. But the Pixel went for a more simplistic route. It doesn’t do all the fancy things that other phones have. But for the essentials and the features it does have, it delivers the best experience in its class. The battery gets through a whole day of use, the camera is the best out there (with the iPhone 7 Plus besting it only because of the 2x zoom), call quality is smooth, and there is literally no lag or stuttering anywhere. Add in the frequent updates and support by Google and this is the equivalent of an Android iPhone. The main issue is the price. Some people might not be willing to spend that much money. But if you can spend the money or want the best of Android, then the Pixel is the best phone available. It is definitely the best phone of 2016.",155.0,Google,"Google Pixel XL G2PW210032GBBK Factory Unlocked Smartphone, 32GB, 5.5-Inch Display - U.S. Version (Quite Black)"

But I recently started looking for a smaller, faster and newer alternative. I love Google phones so pixel was the obvious choice. I found a used pixel 1st Gen 32gb silver for $250 that looked clean in the pictures so I went for it (I bought from TheGizmoTrader btw one of the only 3rd party sellers that provides pictures of their used devices). I'm so happy with the purchase the device was very clean and almost scratch free just as the photos indicated. I'll start by saying this is a very nice phone. The 4 gb of RAM makes a huge difference in speed and overall performance, precessor is very fast, and the camera takes beautiful pictures. Pixel launcher is also a huge step up from the basic Google now launcher. In regards to aesthetics the phone is beautiful, lightweight, and sleek in my opinion, although it is fairly slippery in the hand. An important side note, please be aware that if you are buying a used version of the pixel there is a chance it is the Verizon version which has the oem bootloader locked. This will prevent you from being able to root the phone(although there might be a workaround for this that I'm not aware of).

I don't write too any reviews but I just read through the reviews here and see a few 1, 2, and 3 star ratings. People, if you are going to give poor ratings at least describe what the negative points are. Anyway, back to the phone. I have the 32GB and I am liking the phone more every day. I have had it for 3 days now. It is very fast, all the usual bloat is removed (I always had to root my phones to get all of the unwanted apps off). The camera is fantastic. I work at a technology company where everyone compares their phones and I would say it is right up there with the iPhone 7. The phone build is very sturdy and well built. The fingerprint reader is instant. Pick up the phone and as soon as your finger glides past the reader it instantly unlocks. Couple of negatives that I knew about but still purchased the phone. I wish the phone has an SD slot for expanded memory. I also like batteries that may be replaced but that seems to be a thing of the past. Water resistant - I had the S7 in my hand ready to buy that instead for this very reason but after watching lots of you tube videos it looks like this phone can handle it's share of water. In conclusion, if you are contemplating buying the phone and just can't decide, go to one of the phone stores and check it out before making the purchase.

B01M0PADR4,Heike Doyle,5,"July 19, 2018",True,Excellent phone even in mid to late 2018,"Excellent phone. Even in mid 2018 this phone runs like a dream. It takes fantastic pictures all of the time and in good lighting it is very difficult to differentiate them from the newer pixel 2's photos.You also get unlimited photo storage on google photos at original quality for two years with this device which is great since that aligns with most peoples upgrade cycles. You also get security and operating system updates from google directly which means that you don't have to worry about your carrier or manufacturer not giving you updates if you're not connected to their network or if that phone isn't popular enough for them to support it anymore. Speaking of carriers, this thing supports every carrier. What a concept. And it's unlocked. On Cricket wireless I was getting great reception in the places where reception could be good and now that I have switched to Google's Project fi, I have lte everywhere pretty much all the time. The screen is legible enough out in sunlight and they've polarized the screen in a way that it only blacks out with polarized sunglasses at 45 degree angles so both landscape and portrait work flawlessly. Type c and the headphone jack are wonderful and the battery life is amazing. I can easily forget to charge my phone one night, then if it's at 40 percent or above I can just use it normally the next day and not worry about it or I can put it on the charger if it's too low and get up to where I need to be to finish the day quickly. I have the usual micro scratches in the front glass but with a case on it there has been no damage to the back glass or fingerprint scanner. No dents or chips or wearing of the anodized aluminum back which feels great if you like that sandblasted aluminum feel and it looks pretty slick in black too. The fingerprint scanner works wonderfully and quickly and I love the use of it for pulling down the notification tray. Any who enough of my rambling. This is a great phone for the money now and even in 2018 I can still recommend this phone if you either must have a headphone jack or don't want to shell out the extra cash for new flagships but still want the performance and reliability of one.",3.0,Google,"Google Pixel XL G2PW210032GBBK Factory Unlocked Smartphone, 32GB, 5.5-Inch Display - U.S. Version (Quite Black)"
B01M0PADR4,Jim Wright,4,"September 12, 2018",True,Bluetooth a bit glitchy; otherwise terrific,"I've had this for several weeks now. Pros: the price is hard to beat. Compatible with Android Pie (9). Camera is fast and takes terrific pictures. Its successor has some nice upgrades, but getting a still-supported flagship phone for a midrange price was a worthwhile compromise. For a refurbished device, it was physically flawless. The only clue it wasn't new was the packaging - safe and durable, but not the original, fancy box. Cons: *the Bluetooth can be flaky. an incoming phone call frequently kills the connection with bluetooth headsets or car audio. I often have to reboot the phone and power cycle the headset to reestablish a working connection. Some headsets seem to work a bit better (Beats) than others (generic buds on sale) but I've had more problems with every bluetooth headset than i've had with any previous phone. * The phone gets very hot when running VR (google cardboard) apps. Bottom line: For $300 I got a phone that feels like a flagship. It may not be the king of 2018 or even 2017, but I upgraded from the 2017 ""midrange flagship"" from Motorola and there are very few areas where I felt like I stepped backwards.

B01M0PADR4,Guarana,5,"May 23, 2017",True,Awesome! My new favorite of all time!,"Lengthy Review but worth a read. First pro: and foremost this phone is pretty awesome all around! First con: the device heats up pretty quick when you play heavy games however seems to not get so hot watching Netflix or hulu, tge temperature is about averafe then. Idk uf the heating up from a few minutes of game play is near the alarming temperature or not yet. Gonna do research and compare to my old note device. Seller: I bought this phone ""used like new"" and the package came as if it were sent from Google with the original box and all the necessary items finely packed as if the phone wasnt used. So kudos to the seller for not lying and semding a phone that was beat up. The charging cable was said to be filed down by the seller to fit with bulky cases but thats def no deal breaker at all because I'm sure ill buy a new cable at some point anyways. The phone was unscratched or damaged and had already been factory reset. Setup: Phone setup was the easiest setup I've ever seen on a mobile device personally. There wasnt a self service or cgecking phone status app running in the background knocking out service that I'd have to force close like with my sprint galaxy note 5. There also wasn't an issue popping in a sim card. Just popped​ in the sim card restarted the device and it connected without an issue or extra ingenuity involved. This is how a phone should be! On screen: Being that the phone was manufactured by HTC the srceen looks very much like an htc screen and doesnt get as bright as my note5. Battery: Comparing to my Galaxy note 5 again​, the battery is awesome, much better than my larger battery in my note5 and the software is darn good about shutting down apps that would normally be running in the background unnecessarily. This battery lasts​ me all day and then some. I used to constantly keep power save on 24hrs in attempt to get a decent battery life with my note 5 and any other phone but with the Pixel i actually dont ever feel lile i need it. My battery life is never so horrible that I need to look for ways to save power. I normally get 12hrs out of my battery before really needing a charge. & I purposely try to run out the battery. Camera: The camera is great! Needs a few tweeks to the software but nothing major. I could always download an extra camera apk but i wouldn't get the same great photos. The software does wonders for the pixels camera especially with video recording. Just would like a few things changed like locking in the brightness setting flash and HDR settings small things like that. Again nothing major. Speaker & Pure Android Fingerprint scanner: Plain and simple: the speaker is clear but leaves you looking for more from it but there's always headphones galore & blutooth speakers to make a better experienc.. The pure android experience is a pretty nice feature within itself without the bloatware and sense overlays from manufacturers. Being the first to get updates is cool too. I also noticed i see a lot more apps in the play store that allow me to downlaod the beta versions before they are officially released so that's cool. The fingerprint scanner is pretty cool beijg on the back. I prefer it rather than the one on the note5. Coverage: Comparing to my note5 again haha: Coverage is waaaay better than my note5. Everything from WiFi range & connection strength of that to the strength of the 2g, 3g, & LTE on my pixel is great. I also get way vetter voice coverage so Im usually at full service amd i can still pickup something in bad areas. The pixel also functions on a much wider ramge of frequencies (hence the better signals / connection strength) so I would say this is a true global phone compared to Samsung devices. I used to love my Galaxy but lately its been tough amd has a bunch of small things I'd like to change which I could by rooting if I wanted. so here I am with my Pixel. Some would say it's better to wait for the next one but depending on your situation and needs this may be the perfect fit for you. All in all: I'm happy with my purchase and look forward to future google phones and I feel like i should have been using them since the Nexus days now haha.

B01M0PADR4,Jenni K.,5,"June 24, 2019",True,I LOVE THIS PHONE,"I used to have a Samsung Galaxy Core Prime, so I'll be honest in saying that really anything was probably going to be a step up. When I was looking for a new phone, I really wanted something with a nice camera. The Google Pixel XL certainly delivers. The camera is great for snapping selfies, or, if you're me, taking tons of photos of your dog. They look good in most lighting situations, but obviously will turn out way better in brighter light (such as natural light from the sun) rather than low light / dim lighting. Either way, I'm impressed with the crisp, detailed photos I can get and with this phone my dog just might become an Instagram celebrity. The only thing I don't necessarily like about the phone is that there is no SD card slot. I purchased the 35gb version just after Christmas (so late December/early January) and so far after nearly 7 months have not maxed out the memory. I imagine when I do it will be because of the thousands of high quality dog photos I've been taking (plus a handful of short videos), which I'll just move to a flashdrive or something. Photos are automatically backed up to a cloud if you so choose (which i believe is connected to your google drive??) but i honestly have no idea how to access that, so I'd rather save them externally myself. Overall the phone is responsive and easy to use, I love the camera and the fingerprint scanner is a nice touch that I never knew I needed. The battery usually lasts me about 2 - 2.5 days, but I tend to use my computer a whole lot more than I use my phone. How long it will last depends on how much you're using it, of course. I bought this product used from the seller ""TheGizmoTrader"" who I would recommend because their listings all have photos of the phone so you can see the amount of wear. The phone I picked was listed as ""very good"" quality and looks almost new, aside from a very thin hairline scratch on the screen which is almost unnoticeable. I also received the phone within a week of purchasing it, so I believe this seller is great at getting orders out in a timely manner. If you're on a budget and you want a nice phone, I recommend buying used. I can't even tell that the phone was used before me as it still runs just as well, and I have a case protecting it anyway so any minor scuffs on the body are covered.

B01M0PADR4,K S V,1,"March 27, 2017",False,Bad Battery and Worse Google Customer Service,"Quick review- Phone has battery issue, less than 2 months old completely dies. Ridiculous google customer service and I am STILL waiting on the replacement phone 3 weeks later. Full review- I purchased a brand new pixel- 32GB Quite Black at the beginning of 2017. The batter never lived up to the claims but I thought it was perhaps from extra use (I don't think I use my phone more than any other American, but I do keep a full schedule). 1.5 months into use it completely dies and will not turn on anymore. My husband has the same phone so we contact their chat line, we have had to use the chat line a few times in the last month and thought it was at least some good option to rival Apple having stores you can walk into. They attempt to give some suggestions, but this thing is DEAD. So they say ok we will replace it, but first you have to mail it in to our facility- issue 1, they say once they look it over and verify that it is a manufacture's defect they will send another one, the process should take max of 2 weeks- issue 2 (seriously who can wait without a phone for 2 weeks, if it were Apple you would walk in and get a new phone right away). Being that we have no choice, we have to agree. They say they will send us a shipping label- issue 3, the shipping label doesn't come through, we call again the next day and they send another one (this is important later). The shipping label says you need to package the phone to the best of your ability and if there is any physical defect when it arrives to them then you will be held accountable- issue 4 (why would they not send you any packaging material if they require it to be in perfect condition when it arrives). We wait and wait on the email to come through that says they received the phone, we email, we call (thank goodness we have a second phone to call with), 2 weeks pass- Issue 5. Different google representatives try different things, but they aren't able to track the phone and say this is out of the ordinary but their records show that our phone has not shown up and basically they are trying to nicely say that we never sent it. By the third e-mail and 4th phone call we are giving the current representative both tracking numbers we have (the first shipping label finally came through) and they had on file the OTHER tracking number for our account- Issue 6. Amazingly when they found the right tracking number (2 weeks after this process started) it JUST showed up at their facility JUST this hour (keep in mind this was at 6pm pacific time). They assured us that the review process should take less than an hour and they would ship us a new phone (at the slowest speed possible) as soon as it was approved. We said that was unacceptable that they needed to overnight it to us, since in their words we ""did nothing wrong, there was some fluke in the process between our drop off and the arrival at their facility""- Issue 7. He had to check with his supervisor because that isn't standard- we told him to please check and even better please let US talk to his supervisor, but we were not allowed to talk to a supervisor- Issue 8. He came back and said it wasn't possible, especially since it was a weekend and the earliest anything could be shipped was Monday, we agreed and said we expect to see it Monday then and he said as soon as it was approved it would be shipped out to us. We were on the phone for over an hour since it was magically found, but he still couldn't see a status update- Issue 8, so he said he would call us back as soon as it was approved so we weren't sitting on the phone and that was fine. 3 hours later he calls, but just to tell us that unfortunately there is no status update but it is almost 10pm our time so he wanted to touch base- issue 9 (so much for a 1 hour approval). We told him we wanted to know ASAP and to call us no matter the time and if we didn't pick up we were asleep. He calls again around midnight but we are asleep, there is still no status update. Three days pass and we are at Monday when we should be having a phone in our hands (about 3 weeks since the process started) and we FINALLY receive an email that the phone has been approved, but they will not grant expedited shipping, it will go through regular shipping- Issue 10. This is a horrible company and system and we have talked to about 10 different customer service representatives and they are very sorry for this ""inconvenience"" of not having a phone for 3 weeks and we have NEVER been allowed to talk to anyone higher up or had ANYTHING done to offset their bad process, not even minimal expedited shipping.",16.0,Google,"Google Pixel XL G2PW210032GBBK Factory Unlocked Smartphone, 32GB, 5.5-Inch Display - U.S. Version (Quite Black)"

Google Assistant is also life changing. I can ask for directions, navigate, send texts, make reminders, etc…. all without opening an app. The assistant is always listening, so I can use it hands-free.

B01M0PADR4,AnonZero,4,"August 5, 2018",False,Best Deal in Used Phones,"I bought this phone used locally but wanted to give my feedback here to help potential buyers. First, the build quality is excellent. All metal and gorilla glass, the back does get slightly warm under heavy use and you need to be careful with the half-glass back because it'll scratch on you. But if you take care of your things then scratching it up won't be an issue. I recommend a dBrand skin for at least the glass. Battery life was meh, not as good as I expected but then again my phone was used (although in perfect condition). I get about 7 hours of light use on a full charge, maybe 4 if I'm gaming or editing video. Speaking of video, this camera is amazing. I've never used better on a cell phone and I've owned many different models since 1991. If you unlock the developer mode you can change the color of the phone to sRGB and that reduces the saturation of colors and makes them more accurate, very helpful for on the go video or photo editing. Without sRGB enabled colors look rich and vibrant, the reds almost hurt your eyeballs. Colors pop and blacks are inky black. Speed. This phone is BLAZING fast, especially if you adjust the animation time/length. Things happen immediately on this phone, no lag, no stutter. Try using something like an Aristo 2 or even a BLU phone for a few hours and then jump on the Pixel. It's like night and day. The 4GB of RAM is managed very efficiently by Android and this phone can run Android P Beta, which I'm using right now. You'll always get the latest updated first, while phones like the LG G6 will still have Oreo 8.0 well into 2019. The 5"" model may seem a bit small for someone coming from a phablet but you can fully customize the icon sizes, text size, display size, etc. My last phone was a 5.7"" Nexus 6P and I miss the huge screen a bit but now I can operate my phone with one hand easily, which helps a great deal in certain situations. You can find this phone for between $150-$200 used on Craigslist, OfferUp, and eBay, and it's worth every penny. The Pixel is the best deal in a used phone right now, slightly better than the LG G6 in my opinion. You don't get waterproofing, or wireless charging, but what you do get is an unlocked phone with a million LTE bands that can work anywhere you go basically. I'm using Project Fi and my monthly bill is never over $50. For a phone of this quality that has the ability to seamlessly switch between Sprint, T-Mobile, and US Cellular, it's a no-brainer...buy yourself a used Pixel and you'll be glad you did. If the 5"" model is to small for you the XL model should suit you fine.",,Google,"Google Pixel XL G2PW210032GBBK Factory Unlocked Smartphone, 32GB, 5.5-Inch Display - U.S. Version (Quite Black)"
B01M0PADR4,The Scorpio Reviewer,4,"January 14, 2017",False,A great phone for a pure android experence,I have had this phone a few days and i am very impressed with it. I did not get mine from Amazon but directly from Google. I was coming from an S6 that was unable to make it thru my day without needing to be put on the charger once or twice depending on my usage. I did some research before pulling the trigger between this and waiting for Samsung's next non-exploding phone. I decided to try pure android and i am glad i did. Here are some of my thoughts so far. Pros: 1. No other android phone comes close with how smooth and fluid it works. The pixel launcher is really good. Way better than Samsungs offering and i don't think i will need a 3rd part option like nova. 2. Battery life is amazing. I took it off the charger at 6am and at 2am once i went to bed i still had 30% left. 3. Does not feel too large. I am indifferent with big phones but this one feels the right size for me and does not feel massive. 4. Fingerprint scanner on the back is positioned perfectly and works really well. 5. This camera is really really good. I am used to shooting with a nikon dslr and while this will not replace that it probably really is the best camera in a cell phone all things considered but its not light years beyond what you get with a S7 or Iphone 7 but i feel it produces a better image. (I have compared to the S7 and the Iphone as other family members have them.) Cons: 1. Its expensive. The phone is great but you do pay for it being a Google phone. Personally i think it should be $100-$200 less for not having wireless charging (there is a way to add wireless charging inexpensively)or waterproofing. 2. Way too slick without a case. I was almost scared to use it until my case came. It feels real slippery until you put it in a case which with how much it cost I suggest you do as soon as possible. 3. No wireless charging or waterproofing. If these features are important to you they are not here unless you use some accessories. Overall i think its a great phone just know what you are getting going in. I will comment that everyone that sees it thinks its an Iphone until i tell them its not. The design is what it is. Not stunning nor poor. Very clean. As i said it does look like an Iphone. I will update this review as i use this phone more. One of my issues with Samsung phones over the years is how the performance degrades as it ages. I will be curious to see how this one does.,6.0,Google,"Google Pixel XL G2PW210032GBBK Factory Unlocked Smartphone, 32GB, 5.5-Inch Display - U.S. Version (Quite Black)"

Now for texts, I can only copy the entire text message at once (then paste and recopy and delete the portions I didn't want to copy initially) and some web pages I can't copy text at all. It's super annoying. The worst thing Google is doing is not continuing support for the phone, and probably dropping security for the phone beyond October 2019 (three years after the phone was first produced). I regularly hold onto my phone for years (my wife had a 6-year old iPhone that worked great). Something this expensive should be able to be used for a longer period of time.

Rather than solving my issue they sent me to a third party to check it out, they confirmed it was a Google issue and not a result of anything done by me. What's the difference in this issue and the previous ones they had been so helpful with? Apparently Google had sold faulty devices with this issue and are in the middle of being sued for it. It's been two months and Google just sends me an email every few days letting me know that they are working on it and ignoring any questions I ask.

BUT– that's where the good part ENDS. For all those who ever owned a nice working droid - designed in say.. Motorola standards this is like looking at a phone designed by someone who only once heard a smart phone described to them (possibly in a foreign language) and are not really clear on the idea of WHY would you need it in the first place. Seriously - it's a usability NIGHTMARE! 1. The regular updates (that you are not aware of) are constantly re-arranging menus. Yesterday my key-board was hiding the paragraph return button behind the Add Emoji option (obvious choice to begin with when you are looking for a 'return' option). Today it's been moved and now hiding as an option for capitalizing a letter. Totally intuitive options in both cases from obviously extensive usability testing trials. 2. Fie Sharing - Plugging your Pixel into computer will not let you see files (like normal Androids use to). Now you have to download Android transfer - which .... DOES NOTHING. It Will tell you that you may be not able to connect to anything because your screen is locked - which it isn't. The complete lack of any preferences or options with suggestions on HOW to fix it, adds extra delight to figuring this out. 3. Camera - great quality ... nice options to adjust the picture - all in (surprisingly) in one place ... except the Save function. Which is on top pf the screen - elegantly blending with the photo - while all the menus are still highly visible as menus - on the bottom. 4. Photo storage - Yes it's broken down into albums but you will need some time to figure out the logic behind how those are structures or how much glue the UI designers had to sniff before coming up with the final logic. Still - if you find what you are looking for it may not be there a few days later when the updates been sent out. 5. Sending a text ... A special adventure if you are using it from your addresses. Because while you can find the recipient - it's completely UNclear as to HOW or Where to enter the text. There is actually a number of arrows you need to try before you are allowed to see the text field. Should you need to do this in a hurry - you are out of luck. Adding another person to the text message can only be done Before you start typing it. Sharing a message may be an option but first you will need to figure out HOW to find a person you are sharing it with - the choice of persons given can be random and it is not clear HOW to find the one you need. It may be hidden behind a map icon or just not available at all. Those are just Immediate pleasure I have encountered in the first few weeks of owning this wonder. And I LOVE Androids.

B01M0PADR4,RGG,1,"October 10, 2018",True,"Sold as new, but wasn't","My wife and I have Pixels, so we've purchased two new ones. On top of that, her first pixel had to be sent back and they sent us a brand new one to replace it, so I'm very familiar with the packaging. First hint I didn't have a new phone, I had a charger cable and connector, but the original phones actually came with two cables (one USB-C to USB-C, and one regular USB to USB-C). This only came with one set. Oh, well, I thought, maybe they changed to this a bit later. Second hint, the little tool to remove the SIMM card tray wasn't in the little booklet like the other phones I had opened before. It was at the bottom of the box where the charger cable was. Hmm, again looked suspicious. I gave the phone a quick look to see if it was used. It looked pretty clean, but I didn't look that hard. I set it up and started using it. Ran out of battery halfway through my day. This was definitely not right, as I could get a day and a half of heavy use off my first pixel when it was new. It barely beat out the batter life of the currently 2 year old pixel I'm trying to replace. This was not a new battery at all. So I looked at the phone a bit more closely. The microphone ports were super clean, looked good. But then I found some tiny, tiny scratches on the back and a small scuff on one edge (I put a cover on it as soon as I opened it, literally) when I looked more discriminately. No way this is a new phone. I went back home and opened one of the original pixel boxes we first purchased. The tool to open the SIM tray is definitely different, and the tool in the impostor phone box didn't fit into the cutouts inside the booklet that comes with the phone, which is why they just left it at the bottom of the box. I will be returning it for a refund. It looks like the order was sent by Abe's even though it says Google by the product name. I'll never buy from Abe's again. I'm looking for another place to buy a first gen pixel, as the ones made after January shouldn't have the microphone issue, and with the third generation coming out, they are pretty cheap now. But i'm afraid basically the only people selling pixels now may be cheaters passing off old or refurbished pixels as new.

However after 2 days the ebay phone started making a loud rattling noise when vibrating, the vibrator broke. I returned that ebay phone then purchased this amazon phone. I put in a return for this phone immediately after noticing the low build quality and similarity to the fake ebay phone. However I ended up not returning it. Afterall, it was working just fine. After 3 months of having this Amazon phone, my vibrator also broke and made the same noise as the ebay phone.

The one they sent back is currently showing 55-65%, still a far cry from 80% and is around where I decided to replace the battery in my other phone. Basically, if you buy one of these phones expect to drop another $80 to get the battery replaced (less if you can replace it yourself).

B01M0PADR4,Doc Martin,5,"October 31, 2016",False,Gives Apple a run for the money....this is close to being an I-Killer phone.,"I've owned android based phones since google started rolling them out. I was an early adopter for the Nexus 6 and loved it. I use my tech a lot and when I had the chance to get a Pixel XL through Project Fi, I ordered one. I am very pleased. This phone is light, quick, and responsive. The Google Assistant is a thing of beauty and a sign that all the billions of dollars Google has invested in machine intelligence is paying off for them. Metal case, fingerprint sensor, gorilla glass screen - all pretty much par for the course. The phone is NOT IP68 certified but it does have it's IP53 certification. I've seen some brave - or wealthy - souls who have soaked their XL in a bowl of water for a half hour or so. I am not willing to put mine to the test. Splash, rain, and dust resistant is fine for me. I got a sprigen case and if I am worried about it, I guess I could get an Otterbox or something like that. The fingerprint sensor is responsive and easy to program. The rear camera sports 12.3 megapixels and the front weighs in at 8. Frankly, I pretty much use the camera for apps like Plickers and casual snapshots of the pets at home - this camera is plenty good for these needs. I have very nice digital pocket and SLR cameras for fine photography. Google states they have image stabilization and I guess it's worked well enough for the casual work I've done with the phone. The max aperture setting is f 2.0. The battery is the standard internal battery and it has been a trooper since I got the phone Friday. IMy days start at 0400 and according to the phone, I still have some 15 hours left - and I took it off the cradle around 0420. And I have been working the phone today, folks. There have been a lot of criticisms about the hardwired battery, but an 'Ifixit' video on the Pixel XL teardown indicated that a replacement - if needed - shouldn't be an ordeal. I really like the type C connector and the charging time is insanely short. The Pixel XL does NOT have Qi charging. This was something I questioned but it seems that Qi is something that is falling out of vogue. Again, the phone charges in no time at all, so this isn't a huge deal for me - certainly not a deal breaker. Let's talk about the other power that counts - what's driving the phone. The processor is a quad core snapdragon 821 cpu. Combined with an Adreno GPU and 4 MB of RAM, this puppy runs nougat like a dream. The video is nice and sharp. The Google Pixel XL has a 5.5-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440, The glass is Corning Gorilla glass. I get a tempered glass screen protector for my phones because I am paranoid and I have seen the $6.00 protector 'take one' for the phone. What does this mean in plain English? My youtube videos and movies look great. Storage. Google does not like the idea of SD cards and they didn't choose to change their habits with this phone. I have the 32GB phone and frankly, I am OK with this. I work in the cloud a lot - I have WIfi access pretty much everywhere I go, and I have a handful of apps that I use - I don't need a lot of memory....and I have been using this phone for everything from grading to working on slide shows, lesson plans, student handouts, and working with my Google Classroom - so I am putting this through it's paces. Would more storage be a good thing? I guess - but I have everything I need and am nowhere NEAR capacity. Sound? Good thing I have some nice headphones. The Pixel XL does drop the ball with a single speaker. It's pretty robust, but if you want stereo, I hope you have something to plug into your speaker jack. The USB C interface is promising - it allows for more than just power. There are some promising USB C speaker docks that I have my eye on. Now to Google Assistant. There are two types of people - those who love Google's integration with it's suite of apps and assistive technologies and those who see it as 'big brother' snooping. I fall into the former category. I was a google fan since there was a Google and I've been on the ground floor for most of their offerings. As a teacher, I am a huge fan of their apps. As a busy guy I love being able to ask my phone to help me keep my life organized. I liked Google now and find the new Assistant to be insanely useful. I understand there are a lot of options in Nougat that allow you to modify the access you want to give Google. My carrier is Project Fi (told you I was a google geek) and it's working fine. I understand Verizon is offering this phone as well. Mine came straight from the Google Play Store via Project Fi and is pretty much vanilla Android - which makes me happy. This phone is a premium device and you pay for it. While some criticize that Google could have done better for their first true 'brand' phone, I am very pleased with the performance of my XL. I recommend it highly",52.0,Google,"Google Pixel XL G2PW210032GBBK Factory Unlocked Smartphone, 32GB, 5.5-Inch Display - U.S. Version (Quite Black)"

B01M0PADR4,Yair Gersten,2,"March 16, 2018",False,Very disappointed in Google unfortunately,"Hello, I hoped to give this phone 5 stars because it is pretty great for what I use it for (game apps, vr and regular, mail, YouTube ect.) I was excited for a phone created by the loved Android developer; however, after a year and 4 months, and 5 phones later the warranty is expired and this 5th phone now ALSO doesn't work properly! The two stars are for the phone straight out of the box, it has some great features, I like the fingerprint in the back and the ok Google feature lights up the screen and helps me find my phone. The loss of the 3 stars is because after a few months the ""ok Google"" feature stopped working and I waited a while but eventually complained. This was in the first year and Google sent a refurbished phone (number 2) but the phone they sent had loose volume buttons and poor fingerprint sensor so they sent another refurbished (number 3) which I was a bit annoyed I had to get as they should check the phones before sending them out. This phone (still 3) had very obvious scratches and dents especially on the corners without damaged packaging so AGAIN I sent it back and they sent another. This one (number 4) ALSO had scratches although no dents but I felt it was unacceptable as the original one I sent I had taken very good care of and had no scratches. Finally they got it right... Or so I thought, and sent me a refurbished phone that appeared to be in good condition (number 5). This phone has worked great for about 5 months but now phone calls placed take between 1 and 5 minutes after being unresponsive to actually make the call as well as answering calls cannot be done from the pop up that says answer/decline I have to go to the main call screen and swipe up to answer and Google pretty much says I'm just shit out of luck because even though they never gave me a phone that worked properly for more than 5 months, it's been too long from date of original purchase to replace. After trouble shooting it looks like nothing will work and I will have to live with this atroutiously flimsy calling feature until I can muster the hundreds of dollars I paid Google to get a new different phone. Just outrageous. 2 stars for a cool phone that costs $800/year since it'll definitely break down without question. I suggest you do not buy.

B01M0PADR4,g6kmath,1,"December 25, 2017",False,Replacement of faulty Pixel while abroad,"2 months after Google shipped me the Pixel it started malfunctioning: it can't place or receive calls (everything else works). More specifically the phone will ring but you cannot hear or be heard. Unfortunately I had moved to France (from NYC) in the meantime to study for a year in Paris. The phone is in perfect condition, it is also under warranty and I had also bought insurance from ProjectFi. After spending hours doing all the possible repair options (including factory reset), chatting with customer service and writing endless emails over a month, Google asked me for a shipping address. I thought Google would finally come through and ship me a replacement phone. Here is their last answer: "" A replacement cannot be provided for in a country where Google does not sell the same device. We gave it a try, but we will not be able to process a replacement while you are in France. The Pixel is not sold by Google in France, and so there is no way to send a replacement in that country. Only thing we can do is wait for your return to the U.S., or check if a family member or friend can go through the replacement process for you."" If you happen to move temporarily outside of the 7 countries where Google sells the Pixel, you will not be able to receive any support regardless of whether the device they sold you is faulty. The only offer the internet giant can offer: you take the risk of shipping damage, customs delay, and bear the cost of shipping both ways internationally to a friend, give them your gmail password (great security!) and have them process the replacement from your google account...or you could wait months without being able to place a call till you return to the USA.

Google support lectured me on not charging the phone overnight! just long enough for the phone to say 100 % charged. Oh sure, I will get up an hour after I go to sleep to unplug my phone.

This thing is simple to use, extremely fast and responsive, and has none of the bloatware that other Android phones have. Sure it doesn't have waterproofing or SD card slots which others do, but I'm willing to give both of those up to get this quality of an overall phone. It feels extremely solid, and is easy to grip.

I didn't feel like I ever took lots of photos or videos on my Samsung 6 but I ended up running into memory problems, which I want to avoid going forward. There are some downsides though... 1. It's quiet. The ring tones are quiet. The notifications are quiet. I have the volume turned up high. When it plays music or media, it's fine. But I am missing calls and texts. I also have a random ding that's notifying me of...I don't know what. I can't find what it belongs to. 2. I'm not sure I have the advertised battery life. It seems to poop out earlier than I would expect. I'll have to pay closer attention and request a new phone if it's truly not lasting as long as it should. 3. No message count on text messages. I *really* rely on the visual cue and not having it has been a problem for me. Texts will pop up on the notification screen before you swipe to open the phone but I'm not used to looking there. And my texts are important, I really need static notifications that don't disappear with a swipe. 4. No Verizon suite of tools. I had to ask where the hot spot was. It's tucked away. My Samsung had an icon with all the Verizon stuff I needed. Hot Spot. Voicemail. I miss it. I have no idea where voicemail lives just yet. 5. The Google Assistant is a problem. The Xl came with a 'free' Google Home. Okay. Great. BUT when I want to do something on my phone and say 'Okay Google' almost anywhere in my house (the thing has the hearing of a werewolf), it defaults to Google Home. Well, if I wanted GH to do the task, I would go ask it. I'm consciously choosing to use my phone but noooooo can't have that. Currently GH has an alarm set for 2:30am even though I asked for 2:30 pm for my phone. So I have to hide in my house if I want to set something up on my phone b/c GH is the original buttinsky. Sheesh. I wonder if I can get GH to send that 2:30am alarm to the CEO of Google? Bet he'd like to hear it! The Google Assistant has choked on a lot of simple things. Like setting alarms. I had an error repeatedly telling me 'that time has already passed.' GA is nowhere near as robust as Siri. It needs a lot of work imo. 6. Uploading a 30 second video took a looooooong time for a phone with such a huge memory. That was disappointing. So it doesn't seem to be very fast. I've had it a week.

That said, it's not without a notable flaw that keeps it from five stars. It apparently didn't occur to anyone at Google that they might have loyal customers who have more than one of their devices. In my case, a Google Home. Pre-home I could say ""Ok, google: remind me at the grocery to buy milk"" and the next time I was at a grocery store--any grocery store--I would get a reminder. Awesome. Now the Home interferes. My phone will respond ""answering on another device"" and the Home will tell me it can't do that yet. Thanks, Google. I contacted Google and they offered no solution other than manually pausing the mic on the Home when I want to give a command to my phone alone. No, thanks. The whole point of all this technology is that it's hands-free. Google could easily fix this by allowing customizable wake words. My 2014 Droid Turbo allowed this! Enormously disappointing. I'm going to try to fix it by putting the Home on an auxiliary Google account. This will have its own drawbacks, but since the store-based shopping lists are something I use extensively I think it'll be worth it for me. Also I have a family Play Music account so I can add the auxiliary account as one of the ""family members"" and still have full music access. The pros, however, are too numerous to list. I came to the Pixel by way of the Nexus 5x. I loved the 5x, but it has significant limitations. All worth it to get a pure Google phone with a fingerprint reader.

The AMOLED display on the Pixel has better color accuracy than the iPhone 7 Plus's screen. As for performance, the Pixel phone is faster in real world use than the iPhone 7 Plus.

Sound is good. Sound on call is almost too loud. Camera is okay. Liked the 360 feature, was looking forward to playing with it. As far as I'm concerned, the battery isn't all that good. Others rave about it. I keep my screen brightness down and it still seems like it drains too quickly. However, it doesn't do the simple stuff that my two-year-old Droid Turbo did. I have Android Pay, which requires you to put a lock screen on the phone. With the Droid Turbo using the Moto Voice app, which allows you to set a trigger phrase, I could be lying in bed and ask the phone (across the room) about the weather, or when a store opens, or to call my husband, and it would respond because the trigger phrase acted as a security screen. You can't do this with the Pixel. Once the lock screen engages, you can't ask it to do anything by voice until you have unlocked the screen manually. What the heck use is that? Even worse, this brand new spiffy piece of technology with the great ratings does NOT support USB to Go. On the Turbo I used to be able to plug a USB stick with a micro plug in it and I could transfer files or play whatever files were on the USB stick. Can you do this with the Pixel? Nope. I thought I had to activate something or I was using the wrong type of file manager to access my files, so contacted Google support today about it and they told me you can't use a USB stick with it. I complained to the tech I spoke with and he told me to send feedback to the developers and maybe they would offer the feature in future upgrades. Are you KIDDING me??? This is two-year-old (at least) technology and should already be on the phone!!! When you do a phone upgrade you expect it to be better than the old phone. This one is retrograde.

B01M1CT4PT,Samuel Smith,1,"March 26, 2018",True,"Not New, got scammed by Tek Deals","*edit, moved from 5-1 star* The phone suddenly stopped taking a charge. When I tried to get the phone warranty repaired by Google they stated that the phone was registered under a different email address and was outside of it's warranty period. The phone seemed to be new in package but it was instead a very good re-packaging that simulated new-in-box. Beware, Tek Deals does not sell this as a new phone! Beware. So, 1 star for a refurb phone that failed after only 6 months. I ordered this phone for my wife since the Nexus 6 she inherited from me had the speaker die. We decided that it was finally time for her to get a high quality, not-used phone but she was not willing to spend the money for the latest Pixel generation. From my use and testing, the gen1 Pixel XL is almost as good as it's 2nd gen product. Everything works flawlessly and it is super fast. The camera is amazing, fast and my wife loves it. Since she got the new phone, especially with the unlimited picture upload to Google Photos, she has been taking pictures like a fiend. She cannot stop gushing over how much better the phone is than any she has had. Just a quick note, the only thing gained in the new generation is the ""Squeeze for Google Assistant"" and the auto-song detection. Having used both the XL and the XL 2 now, I can say that there is no real notable difference in performance which makes this phone an even better value. We ordered this using the seller Tek Deals and it came New with the manufacturer seal still in tact. Having only spent $500 for a phone that costs $650 through the Google Play Store is an amazing savings. We even contacted Google to make sure they will still honor the warranty and they confirmed they would. If you want a brand new phone high-end phone but don't want to pay current gen prices, you cannot go wrong with this phone. **Edit** I forgot to mention that the phone received is unlocked, and is NOT the VZW version. I was able to enable OEM unlocking and unlocked the bootloader without issue, just an FYI in case you want to Root this phone or install a Custom ROM/Kernal.",2.0,Google,Google Pixel XL Phone 32GB - 5.5 inch display (Factory Unlocked US Version) (Really Blue)

Was surprised how much longer it lasted. Initially the mic would cut out when I used my headset. Got the patch and it updated so that's fine. Android tends to send a lot of ads which gets a bit annoying. I love how you can turn the data and the wi fi off. I think that's great! You can also create your own hot spot which I haven't done yet but I was reading about it the other day. Ive had a few apps crash on me here and there but not something that happens that often. They're kinda pricey but the benefits that come with it outweigh any phone I've ever had. I've had Android phones in the past and always returned them since some of the features were wonky and archaic. The typical Android seemed so invasive compared to what I had before. I did the exchange program so I sent Verizon an old phone I had on hand and they $100 off of the price. It uses Google Assistant and Voice directions but Ive had Garmin in the car for its just easier to use that and keep the battery good in the phone. It usually lasts a day and half with regular use. I ended up going back to my old phone after a year sorry Android. To many ads for phone thats one of the expensive that out there. Pretty ridiculous!

The speaker volume could be louder and the sound quality of music played or in apps is a little thin.

Also, like Google’s native voice assistant as opposed to Samsung’s clunky Bixby. Even though this model is 3 yrs, it’s still a good buy in 2019 for prices found on Amazon. Update - seller suggests return the phone but did not suggest replacing the charger. The phone will fast charge with OEM Samsung Galaxy S8 but Google Pixel type (can’t seem to find a seller who provides genuine OEM Google charger and card) will not work.

I have terrible reception at my house and experience a large number of dropped calls. It works fine in areas with good coverage. Although I have poor cell coverage at home, this is phone specific. I had the Googe Nexus 5 and had no issues. My wife has the Pixel 3 and has no issues. I have to conclude that either it is because the phone is a Euro version with slightly different bands or a defective phone. In any case, I would avoid the PIxel 2 from this seller.

The Google assistant is much more useful than Siri. Better than Samsung's Bixby at this point. The camera is very impressive for a camera phone.

Just recieving it completely new was a relief, but this phone is really nice. Previously I had a v20 for Verizon and I really liked it. This is similar with an addition of Google assistant Chip was the same so I just slid in my old one. Same charger so that was a plus for me.

B01N2HPFWK,Barbara,5,"August 1, 2019",True,The Battery Life is Now Very Weak,"This Pixel XL that I purchased appears to be like new. No scratches, chips, or dents. It performs well. The one flaw is the battery life. When I went to bed I had it charged to 100%. However, at 5:00 AM my Pixel XL battery was at 85%. My job really calls for me to count on my cell phone. I'll be watching the battery life throughout the course of the day. If it doesn't work out. I'll send the phone back if the battery is too weak. I do realize that this is a three-year-old device. I did reach out to the seller prior to receiving the phone in regards to a tracking question, and he was quick to reply. Hopefully this works out for me. I have now used the phone for two full days. The battery's performance has gotten worse after each day of use. The battery went down from 100% at 1:00 AM to 52% 7:00 AM while I was sleeping. This never happened with my cheap LG Stylo 4 using it under the same conditions. I have requested a refund from the seller, and plan on returning the phone. It's too bad, because it is a clean beautiful phone that has quick responses when typing and using aps. The vendor replied and emailed me the free return shipping label. I have returned the Pixel XL, and I'm now waiting for my refund. 08/15/19 - I'm still waiting for my refund after returning the phone. 08/17/2019 - The seller provided me with a full refund.

(Rural Minnesota) You find some companies are so good, they about own an area or city. I know Sprint works good dome places and T-mobile shoult to. Be sure to look up the bands used by any carrier when purchasing a used phone like this. It may not work as well if certain bands are missing due to it's age. I figured that in with this Pixel.

B01N5BOBIF,Denny,2,"April 29, 2018",True,"Just a lot of bad user interface design choices, finally moving on.","Ugh. Google shows its new to the smartphone business by not understanding usability. I've used many Motorola and Samsung android phones, so I thought it'd be great to go straight to the source of Android and experience the Google genius directly. Big mistake. Googlers can clearly code superbly but that does not mean they know how to configure an experience to avoid the subtle but maddening things. Like prompting for a 4 digit code first thing in the morning when I say ""Hey Google, tell me about my day"", even when I've had their tech support personally walk me through setting up Trusted Voice. Or menus that don't look clickable, because they've never heard of the word ""affordance"". Or a camera app only zooms with pinch motions so I can't hold the phone steady with both hands while zooming (which is when steadiness is most important when taking video)... where even my earliest Motorola droids knew to let me zoom in/out with a simple single finger swipe. I've spent months telling myself I'll get used to the many flaws and fall in love with a bunch of new features. But that never happened.

Small barely noticeable blemish on the top right front. Came with an LG quick charger, works great. Verizon knew I had a new phone as soon as I switch the SIM. Set up was a breeze and it did it wirelessly. My background photo is even the same plus it uploaded all my apps!! I paid just about 500$ I also purchased extras like cables, transfer port, case, screen protector and a fancy attachable wide angle lens w/case. Those will be here in a few more days.. Totalling $630. I still saved a bundle rather than paying MSRP for a new one. Very happy here! Bonus it's hard to find silver 128g, you can't even order it on Verizon online or Best Buy. Only black is avail now or 32g. A few days in I'm have static issues with Bluetooth. Hopefully that is not the reason it was returned in the first place. I'm going to keep an eye on it.

Nougat is quite possibly the best thing to ever happen to the Nexus/Pixel line of mobile devices because of the software optimizations that are being made on a monthly basis, as well as features that made exclusively for the Pixel phones. This phone runs Google's Pixel Launcher on top of Android, a very lightweight UI that is feature packed and optimized for the hardware inside the phone. Although this phone does have a smaller than average battery, I find myself getting more than 10 hrs of battery life with moderate usage, usually around 3 hours of screen-on time with 40% to spare. Compensating for the small battery is easy to to the wicked fast charging that the Pixel offers, My phone can charge from near dead to 100% in less than 1.5 hours. The 4GB of ram and the underclocked Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor are more than enough for everyday tasks, the phone simply flies though everything. Be sure to invest in the 128GB model though as the 32GB model is just not enough. I usually have about 3GB of free space at any given point in time. The camera on this phone is outstanding due to very fast shutter speeds and fast camera launching, the photos are crisp and colorful but not drenched in color or too exposed. Google also has unlimited photo and video backup for media that originates from the phone, the media that is backed up via Google Photos are stored on Google servers at full quality so that they can be viewed on any device without grain from compression. I highly recommend this device to anybody looking for a blazing fast Android smartphone that recieves the latest Android updates when as soon as they become available for download. Android updates are released monthly for security patches, performance updates, and additional software optimizations.

It has a tendency to pocket dial - it has done that at least 4 or 5 times to me. It also recently erased my whole phone while in my pocket - (I was able to restore most of it, but lost most of the information saved by my apps in the phone. I had to set it back up from scratch. Also, not too often, but about once every couple days, it drops a call. That never happened to me with any other phone while in my office. I was going to just coast out with it and get a different phone for my next one, but this has been cumbersome and annoying enough that I probably will go back to a galaxy.

My biggest complaint though it that I switched from a Moto X phone which had Motorola's ""Assistant"" which works better than what is built into the Pixel. I expected features like switching to vibrate mode when any event on my google calendar. The pixel only allows the option to go totally silent. So now I miss messages when I have back to back meetings. Next, the Motorola's Assistant would automatically kick in to voice activation mode when I drove (GPS detects motion). So my text messages were read to me. I expected Google to excel in this area. But it doesn't do any of this! Very frustrating since I didn't even consider that the software on a ""Google"" phone would have worse voice activation features. Also finally recently (1 year later) my ""Google Now"" is acting up. And even though I tell it to work when locked, it sometimes doesn't. This is a huge pain since I don't like messing with my phone when I drive. I foolishly assumed the Pixel would be great in this area. The fix of course is software so hopefully with new upgrades this will improve.

Not only that, but the Google Assistant helps me a lot with a lot of things, such as alarms, reminders, questions, YouTube video look up, and Spotify. However, it is a mono speaker, so the speaker is on the left side if you're facing the screen. Be aware that the spot on the bottom right that might look like a speaker is not a speaker!! It's actually half decoration and the other half is actually a microphone! The hardware looks beautiful, I even bought myself a Spigen case for it so I wouldn't break it. I've been extremely careful with it so I haven't have a huge demand for a screen protector, and I feel it works fine without one. If you're prone to, well, breaking screens, maybe a screen protector would suit you better. It works perfectly with Verizon's network too! Software-wise, it's up to date, as it lets you go even to Android 9.0! Overall, the phone is extremely good (in my opinion, as an Apple convert) and extremely easy to use.

B072N3GKSM,Amazon Customer,1,"October 3, 2018",True,"Beware BuySpry's ""certified refurbished"" Pixel 2!","The day after receiving this phone, it ""froze"" on a single screen for six hours and was completely unresponsive - the screen never changed, the time indicated by the phone did not advance, and none of the icons on the screen or at the bottom of it responded to being tapped. After six hours, the phone ""woke"" by itself. I then turned it off and on again. Since that episode, the flashlight, airplane mode, and adaptive brightness settings have activated frequently at will, without my selecting them. I deselect them, and they reactivate. The volume setting does not stay at the level I select, icons for apps I install appear, disappear, and then reappear. The connection to my WiFi system constantly turns off by itself. Worst of all, the phone and contact apps fail repeatedly. More often than not, when I place a call, the phone indicates that the call is being put though, but no connection is made. When I turn off or restart the phone, the phone occasionally returns to life for one call, then the phone app fails again. I receive constant messages such as ""Phone app isn't responding,"" ""UI system isn't responding,"" and ""Process system isn't responding."" I laid out all this in detail to the seller via Amazon, and asked where to return the phone for a refund. Instead of instructions on how and where to return it, I received the nonsensical reply: ""We do apologize for the issue, can you please explain what is going on with the unit to further assist you?"" It would be hard to have given a clearer explanation than in my original communication to BuySpry. This seller's reply indicates to me that BuySpry doesn't honor its product guarantees, misrepresents the quality of what it sells, and fails to take customer complaints seriously. BuySpry sold me a ""certified refurbished"" phone. In truth, it is ""certified rubbish."" Beware BuySpry! P.S. Since posting this review, BuySpry has contacted me offering to ""repair"" the phone; only if they judge it beyond repair will they refund my money.

I talked to a man who was the service contact provided for this, he said they're phasong out these phones due to complaints and because all of the pixels coming in are trash and Amazon is not vetting the phones or repairing them before resale. Amazon has literally sold me trash. This phone was scratched up and I was okay with that until I realized it had probably been dropped multiple times with no case on it. I had a phone before that I dropped on its side without a case and it had electrical issues afterwards. This phone seemed okay at first but it ran very slow, and suddenly the screen started to go black. I had already ported my number and tried calling someone but the audio jack didn't work, and the actual speaker system wad messed up because I couldn't never be heard when calling. It also made intermittent weird electronic static sounds. This isn't some cheap $5 phone you found in a bin at a garage sale. Amazon is selling these for over $100 and they are very literally the trash that someone else broke and sent back to Amazon. I would advise you not to even try with one of these phones. Based on my conversation with the person who was in charge of complaints, it's not even worth exchanging for the same phone because the whole lot of pixel ones is bad and not being repaired before resale.

It's a great phone and it was in great condition, at least cosmetically. It worked perfectly until exactly two weeks after the deadline for returns, when it started having some really weird audio problems. Phone calls were silent (couldn't hear the ringing or the person's voice/voicemail), sometimes audio will go through the speakers when the headphones are plugged in, other times there will just be a loud buzzing from the headphones. The phone also thinks that it's getting lots of signals from the headphones (volume up/down, play music, triggering Google assistant, and ignoring do not disturb mode - a fun combination when I'm studying in the high quiet section of the library). These problems are usually fixed for a few minutes after I restart the phone, but return quickly. They make it impossible to use the phone as a telephone or to listen to music, watch videos, etc. You definitely get what you pay for with these sorts of things, but I'm really surprised that it broke so badly after working so well for 3 months. Edit: Now about a month later. The phone is almost completely unusable much of the time. Calls rarely ever work, even after restarting, and trying to pick up a call or (god forbid) initiate one usually causes the system UI to stop responding. Even doing a hard reset doesn't always fix it, I've had several times where I had to do two or three hard resets because each time, the system UI would stop responding immediately once the phone was rebooted. I was okay with it when it was just the audio jack not working, but 4 months into having this phone, it's become so unusable that I am forced to get a new phone. I've never had a phone malfunction so horribly, and it's malfunctioning in such bewildering ways, and after such little time.

If you do, I HIGHLY recommend getting a protection plan that covers software issues and will replace phone. You may not have issues right away, but there's a good chance you will down the line, especially after Android OS updates. I bought this phone direct from Google and I hate it so much that I needed to leave an Amazon review for it. Worst Android phone I've ever had, bar none. When I first got the phone I had issues with MMS messaging which I thought was an unlocked phone issue with my carrier but after further researching it and contacting Google, it was an issue that happened no matter the cell service provider. It took about 6mo for this to be resolved from Google with updates/bug fixes. Then the reboot loops started after one of the Android OS updates. After doing some research, this seems to be a common issue with Pixel 1's and other Google-supported phones. Boot loops happened after subsequent Android updates, I've had to factory reset it twice. Now after the most recent update (Android 9) I can no longer make calls due to a critical software issue that seems to be a fairly common issue based on threads on Google support. There is no fix for this as factory reset did not resolve the issue. I called Google support and they basically told me that I had to get a new phone or replace the motherboard (which costs almost as much as a new phone). Don't get me wrong. When this phone works, it works phenomenally. Lightning fast, fantastic camera, and it handles multiple apps open and running at once better than any other Android I've had.

We returned it. Then we ordered a regular Pixel, because she also decided she prefers a smaller phone. It arrived with microphone not working.

The first was through walmart and that one was a complete failure it had all kinds of cosmetic issues, scratches dents etc and despite being advertised as new it clearly was not. Was a nightmare to return on top of it. The second was through new egg and i got an email from the seller asking if i was sure i wanted it which immediately started the alarm bells then they asked for more money for shipping and I just said forget it. Tried one more time with amazon because I knew if there was an issue it would be taken care of. So glad I did it came fast and was basically flawless.

Not a single scratch. But I noticed that the battery seemed sub-par, but not enough to prove that it was problematic. Warranty was 3 months, so conveniently for the seller, it wasn't until about the 5-6 month mark when the battery started to show conclusively that it was having trouble holding charge: by that point, the phone wouldn't hold a charge for more than a few hours, and it wouldn't hold a charge for more than a few minutes when the temperature got down to about 40F (which it didn't get cold enough to test until after the phone warranty was up). The refurb process apparently doesn't include any kind of battery testing. So if you think this is a good deal, add in a new battery to your budget before you decide. Update at the 7th month after purchase: Phone no longer runs for more than 20 minutes without freezing and rebooting itself. I tried factory reset, but it does the same thing even after a reset.

B0766HPGYP,Vincent,5,"November 13, 2017",False,Upgraded From Nexus 6P,"Going to compare this to Google's other phone, the Nexus 6P since it's been my daily driver before owning this phone* and describe the Pixel 2 from that perspective Decided to switch over since I miss owning a 5inch phone and the battery life on the 6P is not as good as it used to be. First thing I like to say is that there is no night-and-day difference between these two phones. The Pixel 2 has better functionality in most cases, but the Nexus 6P still hold up really well as is not outdated whatsoever. Last week, the 6P had its Android Oreo over-the-air software update. Well read on if you're on the fence. *Skipped out on Pixel 1 since it didn't have front facing speakers --Battery Life Pixel 2 wins this hands down, even better than the 6P when I got it out of the box at launch. Can last up to 1.5 to 2 days if you're conservative. Example: Typical 8 hour work day +1 hour commute (half hour to and from work) + 30min lunch break During commute non stop music. 80% volume Lunch 20-25mins on Youtube 15min breaks: some light mobile gaming, Two 2-3 minute phone calls Check e-mail text and notifications throughout the day Doing all of this. Starting from 100%, dropped down to 48% by the end of the day Super fast charging with included charger. Very similar to the Moto X Pure, but the batter life is way longer. Takes about an hour and a half to fully charge your phone from 10% --Camera Better stabilization/auto focus The auto focus on the 6P is horrible, even if you tap on the screen it will not focus accurately. On the Pixel 2 it auto focuses on an object for you without having to touch the screen and does a decent job at it too. 6P does a better job at capturing true real life colors especially in scenery. Pixel 2 makes everything more vibrant and seems like it auto photo-shops everything (which can be a good or bad thing depending on your preference). Pixel 2 has way better front facing camera. Excellent for selfies as it auto blurs the background and do automatic lighting touch ups on your face. Video works way better as there's less camera shake when playing back Did a blind camera test with phones I have available**, borrowed from friends/family and the Pixel 2 had better quality picture hands down. **Nexus 6p, iphone7, Galaxy 7 Edge, Note 4, Moto x pure, Amazon Fire Phone. Note that I don't have access to all high end phones such as iphone X, Note 8, HTC U11, LGV30 along others. --Finger Print Sensor Both very similar. Didn't notice a difference. Was able to detect 100% of the time with dry/clean fingers --Visual aesthetic, build quality Don't know about some people, but I love the camera visor hump on the 6P. Makes it look very futuristic and stands out from other phones. The Pixel 2 on the other hand, looks very generic and plain. The Pixel 2 does not have a streamline look like iphone x or Galaxy edge series as the screen not edge-to-edge. It has large bezels on the top and bottom which i don't really mind since I'm not accustomed to bezel-less screens, but i can see how some people are if they're used to it. Having bezels does have it's advantages as it's great for mobile games where you have to hold your phone horizontally Pixel 2 is also very lightweight. Even lighter than the Nexus 5 and feels very fragile. This is the only phone i bought a case for a week after purchase. Pixel 2 is dust and water resistant. Great for traveling, if you're an extrovert, or an adventurer with no arrows to the knee I don't like the side buttons. For the 6P the power button has this cross hatch metal texture design to it making it easily distinguishable from the volume rocker. For the Pixel 2, all the buttons feels the same, so it takes some time to get a feel for it Personal preference, but i like the 5inch display rather than the 6inch (thus one of my main reason for switching). 6inch is better for viewing cinematic movies/videos, but I already own a laptop and tablet and those tend to do a better job. I find a 5inch phone more portable and less finger travel when using --UI Android Oreo is very smooth. You will not notice a difference from the 6P with Android Oreo unless you compare them side by side. Pixel 2 is slightly faster, but only by milliseconds. Most of it probably have to do with finger travel from larger screen --Front facing speakers At first i assumed it would be muffled compared to the 6P due to the water and dust resistance, but it's surprisingly better than the 6P at higher volumes. At around 80% + volume there's much less distortion on the Pixel 2. Not to say that the 6P is bad, but once you hear the sound quality at near max volume from the Pixel 2 it's hard to go back. No headphone jack on the Pixel 2. So you have to resort to bluetooth for personalized music. This can be troublesome if you are an audiophile especially if you already own a expensive wired headset But if you are a true audiophile, and can afford it, i would get a dedicated mp3 player. Namely the Sony Walkmen brand It does come with a USB-C to 3.5mm cable in box -Software update New android software first on Pixel 2 for 3 years instead of 2. 6P still have updates as mentioned before it updated to Andriod 8.0 last week I also own the Nexus 5 (phone released in 2013) and it still receives security updates from Google, but it stopped getting major software updates (stopped at Android 6.0.1) probably due to hardware limitations. Pixel 2 like other Google phones has no bloatware like ones you see on Samsung phones as is pure android -Active Edge At first i thought it was a throw away feature, but I find it quite useful overtime In the beginning i just used it to set alarms, but after a while starting using it for the Android Assistant. It's very similar to pressing on the google search bar, but much faster. Note that if your phone is off and you use the squeeze feature,you are automatically prompted to the lock screen. Exception being you have no passcode, you have trusted locations or trusted bluetooth devices active. Trusted faces also work, but it takes a second extra for it to boot up. When the phone is on, it's very intuitive, as it's easier to ask the assistant anything from directions and reminders on the fly. You can also squeeze to silence phone calls instead of pressing the volume rocker if you see a spam or phone number of a person you don't' have to talk to at the moment --Google Lens Google lens is similar to Amazon Firefly (on the Amazon phone that no one uses?). It's better at picking up words, number and text than objects -Always on Display/ ""Now Playing"" Out of the box, the Pixel 2 has an always on display showing the time/date, and app icon notification. You can go to settings and turn this off if you want to save battery life. If you have it off, you can easily access it by double tapping on the screen. Always on display is great when you're sleeping and as you can glace over to look if you have it on a smartphone stand on the nightstand Pixel 2 has a ""Now Playing"" feature which auto detects music playing in the background with is great as you don't have to ask google assistant for it or use a 3rd party app like Sound Hound. Song has to play in background for 10-20secs in most cases before it's able to display on your phone depending on how loud, clear and popular the song is. --Transfer Process Easy to transfer data use included adapter. If you own an android phone, all apps will transfer over, you just need to re-enter some passwords if it's not connected directly to your google account. You can also transfer iphone data over but it's only contacts, and photos ----Overall a good upgrade if you like the enhanced features. 6P is still a good phone and is not outdated in terms of software and hardware. If you find the upgraded/new features on the Pixel 2 enticing then it's a good upgrade.

The Pixel 2 launched at about the same time as the iPhone 8 (also with a great camera & video setting) but currently can be purchased for roughly half the cost of an iPhone 8! So for me, it really came down to cost. Photos are amazingly sharp/detailed and ""night sight"" is truly incredible. Like all single lens cameras, the digital zoom is to be avoided, but I already knew that. Video is good, not great but I don't shoot much video so it isn't an issue for me.

B0766HPGYP,Lucas,4,"April 28, 2019",True,Great upgrade over the original pixel,"I purchased a used version of the pixel 2 after having some bad luck with a refurbished original pixel. I can say that it was a great decision in that I saved hundreds of dollars and got a unit in excellent condition. The pixel 2 is a great smartphone and made numerous improvements over the original pixel. The cameras are my favorite part of this phone, they take amazing photos and I can't believe how professional the photos look when implementing portrait mode. They look like something straight out of a magazine. Low light environments still result in some graininess but the low light feature does help. Processing performance is impressive, I rarely see the system chug and I can carry out plenty of multitasking. The front facing speakers don't offer the cleanest sound but as someone who used to accidentally cover the speaker on the bottom of the original pixel I am a huge fan of the new speaker locations. The display is fine and I like the options to choose how much color saturation you desire. Active edge is a cool feature but I don't find myself using it very often. It requires a good deal of force to activate and it often requires squeezes in multiple places to finally trigger the assistant. One of my gripes with this phone is that it is no longer compatible with Anyview Cast on my Hisense smart TV so I'll probably need to purchase a chromecast in the future if I want to do things such as screen mirroring to my 4k tv. I've read that it also no longer supports Miracast. The battery life is great and I always have plenty of battery left over at the end of the day with moderate usage. The fingerprint reader is super fast and located on the back of the device. The fingerprint is located in a place the feels very natural for my pointer finger to rest on. This is a great phone with a great camera and I would recommend it to anyone looking to replace their original pixel or older android smartphones.",2.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 128GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black

Selecting any of these options simply returns back to the same exact screen. All of this would be fine as the product page says it comes with a US warranty, and this looks to be just a lemon, which does happen with technology and tends to be the purpose of these warranties. Unfortunately, the seller claims this warranty is through Google, and Google only has warranties for authorized resellers, which I have been informed that this seller is not. I will continue to reach out until this has been resolved, and am hopeful an exchange/refund is possible, as I would not have bought a phone with no warranty and just being out $550+ is no fun.",2.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 128GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black

B0766HPGYP,Diane,1,"March 21, 2019",False,Warranty and service are completely useless,"I have a pixel 2 phone that is less than a year old, under warranty, and in perfect condition. It started to have charging issues and eventually it stopped charging entirely. The problem is not the charger or the mechanics of the connector: my spouse has an identical phone, so it's easy to test the charging equipment and the connector is completely clean. Google ""diagnosed"" it over a web chat (all their service is from overseas, from my experience) and offered me an ""advanced replacement"", which amounts to them sending me a new phone, after which I send this one back. The problem is that any replacement process involves a web page that doesn't work. It has been 4 days since my phone died, and they still have not even started a replacement process: they send me a web link, I click on the web link, and I get a message ""It's not you, it's us. We're working on fixing the problem. Check back soon."" Any calls or chats to the company involve repeated requests from their representatives not to worry: they're working on it. No escalation path is provided, no alternative solutions; if you can't get their link to work, you don't move ahead, and their link doesn't work. Any self-respecting vendor would just send me another phone, but this dystopian giant demands that everyone follow the yellow brick road that leads to a precipice. No wonder people hate google! This is how outsize companies eventually end up being broken up. Edit: It's been a month since I wrote this review, and I've recovered from most of the frustration... Here's how it went: after 7 days, google sorted out it's webpage error, and I was able to return my first phone. Of course, I had to buy a cheap phone in the meantime, to the the tune of about $100. They promptly sent me a second phone (which you have to sign for at home, so have it sent to your place of work!). After about a week, I noticed the front-facing camera didn't work, so I went through the required hour of chat conversation and returned it. The second phone worked otherwise, so it wasn't that big a deal. The third phone arrived, and by this time I am really good at re-installing apps and backups, and this time I actually have the second phone to do it from, so it wasn't too bad. I went on vacation to Paris, and bingo, the third phone dies with a message: ""Slot unbeatable: Load Error"". This is the kiss of death. The phone is now a brick. When I get back from Paris next week, I'll start the return process yet again. Since I now have so much experience with the chat help, I can say that it's not bad (I correct my earlier statement disparaging the chat support), but the phone hardware is apparently garbage (in my experience), so my recommendation is DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM GOOGLE. And by the way, each time you do one of these returns, they put a $600 hold on your credit card.

The only way I can open any camera is by using voice command to open the 'selfie' cam on the front. This all happened after an update to the app. It seems many people using Google Pixel phones are having this issue and Google is not fixing the bug.

It's like a fog horn going off. Maybe this is only with the verizon text ap, but that is my preferred texting app. 2- squealing. perhaps if you don't have excellent hearing, this isn't a biggie. but since day one, there has been a terrible squeal in the background of phone conversations. not there on bluetooth, not there when listening to voicemails 3-texts dont send. sometimes the button to send out a text doesnt respond the first 5 or 6 times 4-the square button that gives you a scrolling window through all your open apps doesnt always work I really wanted to like this phone. I've never owned an apple product, I'm not looking for an excuse to go to mac. It's genuinely terrible in so many ways. I'm not a fan of the no headphone port.

B0766HPGYP,Kindle Customer,1,"January 4, 2018",True,"Awful! Worst purchase in years. ALL INTERFACES NON-STANDARD!! INCLUDING CHARGER!! And headphone. No written info, YouTube only.","This is the most disappointing technology purchase I have made in the last several years. And I haven't even had it up yet as a phone or camera. I am seriously debating taking the restock fee hit and returning it. Why? It has an UTTERLY non-standard interface, both for simple charging, and for audio! It has NO! standard headphones jack, nor any simple organizational method for creating a foldesr and putting your apps in them. At least, I can't see where it does. It also DOES NOT HAVE ANY WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION!! NO MANUAL! And forget even an online manual --- all it has is a bunch of stupid, useless **non-searchable** YouTube UNCAPTIONED ""how do you what I think maybe someone somewhere - maybe - might want to do"" videos - and can I return to the NO standard audio interface? The charging cable is non-standard. Not only is the cable non-standard, but the WALL PLUG (AC/DC) adapter is NONSTANDARD. I can't even charge from the DC-DC (""cigarette lighter"") adapter in my car. You will need to buy a special adapter for each and every outlet you want to use in your house. And a SEPARATE, SPECIAL CABLE for each cable you want to have. God forbid you ever travel with this phone: loose your adapter - OR EVEN YOUR CABLE - and you will not be using your phone again until you can get somewhere to receive special orders. Unlike the Apple non-standard adapters and cables, I've never seen either these ""special"" cables or their adapters for sale anywhere. And at least I can plug a non-standard Apple cable into a standard USB adapter. There is no jack for headphones. Or external (""hard-patch"") output to any sound or other source that I can find. I did mention no manual - right? I can only assume Google thinks we all should carry ""blue-tooth bricks"" around with us... but who want to carry heavy blue-tooth headphones in their purse all the time?? Not to mention they are expensive and mine, at least, seem to fail routinely. VERY VERY EXPENSIVE!!!!! To get a headphone for home and one for work and one for the car (for the gym) I'll have an added $150+ expense I had not counted on. It may be that the absence of any manual is the worst thing. I was actually offended by the abysmal quality of the YouTube videos. If I'd wanted to be entertained I'd *go* to YouTube --- not try to get specific, simple ""how in fact can I --- or even can I?? -- make a folder to separate my Spanish from my English from my personal from my work-related apps?"" information. Not to mention simple things like the ... ok, does the only port you do have - the non-standard USB port - output to headphones? And where might I ever get such a thing?? REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD JOB!!!!! NOT something I would have expected from Google. (God forbid I ever actually encounter one of their cars!!!!!! It is NOT reassuring!!) -UPDATE- I found adapters for this weird interface on Amazon - I guess some very new other items use them too - but I stick with my original review. DO NOT travel with this phone - you will not find the cables and chargers.

B0766HPGYP,P. Robichaux,5,"October 29, 2017",False,amazing,"I've had android and iPhone before. There are pro/con's for both but I like Android better. That being said, this phone perfectly exemplifies what Android is supposed to be. Design: I miss the headphone jack. i use corded headphones regularly. That being said, I rarely use the headphone jack and charge the phone at the same time so using the USB-C to 3.5 mm audio adapter hasn't been an issue. An added plus of using the adapter is I no longer have to deal with certain headphone plugs not fitting due to my case not providing a big enough opening. I love that the speakers both face the front.I had adapted a way of holding other phones in a way so that my hand cupped the sound and directed it to my face. No longer needed. Otherwise, the phone is pretty standard as far as premium phones look. You'll likely use a case anyway this isn't really an issue. Performance: There is absolutely no lag in this phone. As soon as you touch a button or spot on the screen, its already where you need to be before the entire weight of your finger crashes down. You can snap photos one after the other and not face any dreaded processing hold screen. OK Google detection is much improved. Not sure if this is due to hardware or software, but I no longer have issues waking my phone up to tell it to create a reminder or something like that. Also, I haven't noticed it responding to others saying OK Google like my previous phone did, but I wasn't on Oreo yet so that could also be why. (but I can't rule out better microphone hardware that might be able to provide better signal to noise ratio) Finger print sensor is lightning fast. Haven't had too many issues with my fingerprint not reading although I did load the same finger twice to get better results. Battery life: With my previous Nexus 5x, if I used the phone (basic stuff like reading news, listening to music, and maybe watching a couple youtube videos/using the maps app) I could maybe make it half a day. With the Pixel 2 after a day of light use I still have 50% battery left. I could likely go 2 days of light use or 1 day of heavy (watching videos) use. Display: The display is absolutely beautiful. The new screen allows for individual pixels to be turned on or off which makes the blacks super dark as there's no backlight. I think this is also why the battery life is so awesome. As a plus, the time, date, temperature, and icons of notification types are able to be displayed on the phone at all times. This is awesome as it makes the phone a true nightstand clock replacement and you can even tell if you missed a text without touching your phone. Camera: Don't get me wrong, the camera is the best I've seen on a phone. But comparing to the Nexus 5x, you don't notice THAT much of a difference.However, with the performance, you can actually take pictures and not have the phone crash on you. Overall, I've been hearing talk of how the pixel 2 still isn't fully complete as in they're missing features, but I can't imagine how necessary they are.

The customer service was so excellent, that it was clear that I was speaking to someone who understood the product and who could connect it to my needs.

This Pixel 2 is actually an HTC phone so it was easy to pick it over the XL when I found out that LG made the XL and the new HTC 12U only came as an large format phone. What guy wants a phone he can't put in his pocket? It was so easy to copy everything over from my old HTC M9 and then to customize it.

The honeymoon was fantastic! But after a few months and a few OS updates, I started to experience several issues with it. I gone through months of troubleshooting and am now on my 3rd phone. Most of the issues have been worked out except for one HUGE issue. I am unable to maintain a smooth connection on my home WiFi network. I've tried everything and worked with Google support. I get sporadic WiFi connected but has no internet issues constantly. As a result, I am forced to shut down apps or videos several times before things finally reconnect and work again. This also happens on my parent's WiFi. No issues at work or other places. I've also been experiencing text issues the last few weeks, as well. I receive an Error 97: SMS origination denied message when sending texts out. I've spoke to Verizon 4 times and have gone through troubleshooting and they insist there is something wrong with the phone. It has, quite honestly, been maddening. All Google support is willing to do is replace my phone with another refurb. I am beyond frustrated and am extremely disappointed with Google.

B0766HPGYP,Mr. Dizzystick,3,"December 18, 2017",False,Did not meet my expectations,"When friends ask me about my Pixel 2, I tell them ""it's all right"". I've been using an iPhone 4 for the past 5 years, so I was looking forward to this phone feeling like a significant upgrade. However, after 2 weeks of using the Pixel 2, it seems my expectations were too high. Compared to iOS, most things on Pixel 2 feel different but rarely better (or worse, to be fair). For example, Google Assistant feels just as limited as Siri - it's only helpful about 20% of the time I use it. Having everything on my phone synced with my web browser (Chrome) is nice, albeit a bit unnerving - I'm constantly reminded about just how much personal information Google has stored. It's cool being able to sign into a site on my phone for the first time using saved login information from my computer, but this feature is a bit inconsistent and does not always work when I expect it to. I like being able to edit notification settings directly from the app icons on my desktop, but overall I feel like I receive far more notifications than I used to on my iPhone (I think because apps on iOS ask upfront if you want notifications whereas on the Pixel 2 you have to seek out these settings). Speaking of notifications, my phone alerted me my cable bill was do in 24 hours - a bill I had already paid a week prior. I think the phone scanned my emails for bill notifications, yet missed the email confirming I paid. Again, I was a bit unnerved that the phone (or Google, or whatever) is scanning my emails. Naive, I know. The camera's nice, though I still get grainy shots when the lighting isn't great (which may be expected?). Camera quality is neither my priority nor something I know much about so I'm unable to say more than pictures look much better than what I used to get on my dated iPhone. I've really only had 1 bad experience so far: I had to download 5-6 different podcast apps to find one that had all of the functionality I was seeking. For whatever reason, Google's default player, Play Music (not to be confused with Play Store, which is a different default app with a similar triangle logo) is missing one of the podcasts I regularly listen to, and a few of the apps I tried that do have this show were missing functionality I wanted. I eventually found an app called Podcast Republic which seems to suit my needs. All in all, it was a hassle to find what I liked, especially compared to iOS where the default podcast player served me so well. One last note: an app (Animal Crossing) stopped working after an update but restarting my phone resolved the issue. Just like a computer, it seems restarting is now the go-to first step in resolving issues, which is certainly manageable but not ideal. Pixel 2 is fine, I slightly regret the purchase mainly because I had such high hopes. I think I would have preferred an iPhone simply for the familiarity (again, I don't feel Android is worse than iOS, I just don't believe the differences are actual improvements).",22.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 128GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black

B0766NJPBN,Vincent,5,"November 13, 2017",False,Upgraded From Nexus 6P,"Going to compare this to Google's other phone, the Nexus 6P since it's been my daily driver before owning this phone* and describe the Pixel 2 from that perspective Decided to switch over since I miss owning a 5inch phone and the battery life on the 6P is not as good as it used to be. First thing I like to say is that there is no night-and-day difference between these two phones. The Pixel 2 has better functionality in most cases, but the Nexus 6P still hold up really well as is not outdated whatsoever. Last week, the 6P had its Android Oreo over-the-air software update. Well read on if you're on the fence. *Skipped out on Pixel 1 since it didn't have front facing speakers --Battery Life Pixel 2 wins this hands down, even better than the 6P when I got it out of the box at launch. Can last up to 1.5 to 2 days if you're conservative. Example: Typical 8 hour work day +1 hour commute (half hour to and from work) + 30min lunch break During commute non stop music. 80% volume Lunch 20-25mins on Youtube 15min breaks: some light mobile gaming, Two 2-3 minute phone calls Check e-mail text and notifications throughout the day Doing all of this. Starting from 100%, dropped down to 48% by the end of the day Super fast charging with included charger. Very similar to the Moto X Pure, but the batter life is way longer. Takes about an hour and a half to fully charge your phone from 10% --Camera Better stabilization/auto focus The auto focus on the 6P is horrible, even if you tap on the screen it will not focus accurately. On the Pixel 2 it auto focuses on an object for you without having to touch the screen and does a decent job at it too. 6P does a better job at capturing true real life colors especially in scenery. Pixel 2 makes everything more vibrant and seems like it auto photo-shops everything (which can be a good or bad thing depending on your preference). Pixel 2 has way better front facing camera. Excellent for selfies as it auto blurs the background and do automatic lighting touch ups on your face. Video works way better as there's less camera shake when playing back Did a blind camera test with phones I have available**, borrowed from friends/family and the Pixel 2 had better quality picture hands down. **Nexus 6p, iphone7, Galaxy 7 Edge, Note 4, Moto x pure, Amazon Fire Phone. Note that I don't have access to all high end phones such as iphone X, Note 8, HTC U11, LGV30 along others. --Finger Print Sensor Both very similar. Didn't notice a difference. Was able to detect 100% of the time with dry/clean fingers --Visual aesthetic, build quality Don't know about some people, but I love the camera visor hump on the 6P. Makes it look very futuristic and stands out from other phones. The Pixel 2 on the other hand, looks very generic and plain. The Pixel 2 does not have a streamline look like iphone x or Galaxy edge series as the screen not edge-to-edge. It has large bezels on the top and bottom which i don't really mind since I'm not accustomed to bezel-less screens, but i can see how some people are if they're used to it. Having bezels does have it's advantages as it's great for mobile games where you have to hold your phone horizontally Pixel 2 is also very lightweight. Even lighter than the Nexus 5 and feels very fragile. This is the only phone i bought a case for a week after purchase. Pixel 2 is dust and water resistant. Great for traveling, if you're an extrovert, or an adventurer with no arrows to the knee I don't like the side buttons. For the 6P the power button has this cross hatch metal texture design to it making it easily distinguishable from the volume rocker. For the Pixel 2, all the buttons feels the same, so it takes some time to get a feel for it Personal preference, but i like the 5inch display rather than the 6inch (thus one of my main reason for switching). 6inch is better for viewing cinematic movies/videos, but I already own a laptop and tablet and those tend to do a better job. I find a 5inch phone more portable and less finger travel when using --UI Android Oreo is very smooth. You will not notice a difference from the 6P with Android Oreo unless you compare them side by side. Pixel 2 is slightly faster, but only by milliseconds. Most of it probably have to do with finger travel from larger screen --Front facing speakers At first i assumed it would be muffled compared to the 6P due to the water and dust resistance, but it's surprisingly better than the 6P at higher volumes. At around 80% + volume there's much less distortion on the Pixel 2. Not to say that the 6P is bad, but once you hear the sound quality at near max volume from the Pixel 2 it's hard to go back. No headphone jack on the Pixel 2. So you have to resort to bluetooth for personalized music. This can be troublesome if you are an audiophile especially if you already own a expensive wired headset But if you are a true audiophile, and can afford it, i would get a dedicated mp3 player. Namely the Sony Walkmen brand It does come with a USB-C to 3.5mm cable in box -Software update New android software first on Pixel 2 for 3 years instead of 2. 6P still have updates as mentioned before it updated to Andriod 8.0 last week I also own the Nexus 5 (phone released in 2013) and it still receives security updates from Google, but it stopped getting major software updates (stopped at Android 6.0.1) probably due to hardware limitations. Pixel 2 like other Google phones has no bloatware like ones you see on Samsung phones as is pure android -Active Edge At first i thought it was a throw away feature, but I find it quite useful overtime In the beginning i just used it to set alarms, but after a while starting using it for the Android Assistant. It's very similar to pressing on the google search bar, but much faster. Note that if your phone is off and you use the squeeze feature,you are automatically prompted to the lock screen. Exception being you have no passcode, you have trusted locations or trusted bluetooth devices active. Trusted faces also work, but it takes a second extra for it to boot up. When the phone is on, it's very intuitive, as it's easier to ask the assistant anything from directions and reminders on the fly. You can also squeeze to silence phone calls instead of pressing the volume rocker if you see a spam or phone number of a person you don't' have to talk to at the moment --Google Lens Google lens is similar to Amazon Firefly (on the Amazon phone that no one uses?). It's better at picking up words, number and text than objects -Always on Display/ ""Now Playing"" Out of the box, the Pixel 2 has an always on display showing the time/date, and app icon notification. You can go to settings and turn this off if you want to save battery life. If you have it off, you can easily access it by double tapping on the screen. Always on display is great when you're sleeping and as you can glace over to look if you have it on a smartphone stand on the nightstand Pixel 2 has a ""Now Playing"" feature which auto detects music playing in the background with is great as you don't have to ask google assistant for it or use a 3rd party app like Sound Hound. Song has to play in background for 10-20secs in most cases before it's able to display on your phone depending on how loud, clear and popular the song is. --Transfer Process Easy to transfer data use included adapter. If you own an android phone, all apps will transfer over, you just need to re-enter some passwords if it's not connected directly to your google account. You can also transfer iphone data over but it's only contacts, and photos ----Overall a good upgrade if you like the enhanced features. 6P is still a good phone and is not outdated in terms of software and hardware. If you find the upgraded/new features on the Pixel 2 enticing then it's a good upgrade.

B0766NJPBN,Lucas,4,"April 28, 2019",True,Great upgrade over the original pixel,"I purchased a used version of the pixel 2 after having some bad luck with a refurbished original pixel. I can say that it was a great decision in that I saved hundreds of dollars and got a unit in excellent condition. The pixel 2 is a great smartphone and made numerous improvements over the original pixel. The cameras are my favorite part of this phone, they take amazing photos and I can't believe how professional the photos look when implementing portrait mode. They look like something straight out of a magazine. Low light environments still result in some graininess but the low light feature does help. Processing performance is impressive, I rarely see the system chug and I can carry out plenty of multitasking. The front facing speakers don't offer the cleanest sound but as someone who used to accidentally cover the speaker on the bottom of the original pixel I am a huge fan of the new speaker locations. The display is fine and I like the options to choose how much color saturation you desire. Active edge is a cool feature but I don't find myself using it very often. It requires a good deal of force to activate and it often requires squeezes in multiple places to finally trigger the assistant. One of my gripes with this phone is that it is no longer compatible with Anyview Cast on my Hisense smart TV so I'll probably need to purchase a chromecast in the future if I want to do things such as screen mirroring to my 4k tv. I've read that it also no longer supports Miracast. The battery life is great and I always have plenty of battery left over at the end of the day with moderate usage. The fingerprint reader is super fast and located on the back of the device. The fingerprint is located in a place the feels very natural for my pointer finger to rest on.

E-sim capability is perfect for giving the ability to switch back and forth between two or more networks easily. Android Q is updated into it now and is working great. The camera is so awesome. Takes great pictures and video. Only downfall I see is no headphone jack and no SD card slot although with one of those fancy adapters which are cheap that can plug into your charging USB-C port, you can use them for 3.5mm headphones on one end and either OTG memory or charging on the other side. Then you're all set. With 64 gigs. And 400 apps my memory is still over 50% free though anyways and I can't see myself needing many more apps. For $210.00 USD was a great deal and although it was a used unit there wasn't a single sign of use noticeable and the battery is still holding an awesome charge.

It started to have charging issues and eventually it stopped charging entirely. The problem is not the charger or the mechanics of the connector: my spouse has an identical phone, so it's easy to test the charging equipment and the connector is completely clean. Google ""diagnosed"" it over a web chat (all their service is from overseas, from my experience) and offered me an ""advanced replacement"", which amounts to them sending me a new phone, after which I send this one back. The problem is that any replacement process involves a web page that doesn't work. It has been 4 days since my phone died, and they still have not even started a replacement process: they send me a web link, I click on the web link, and I get a message ""It's not you, it's us. We're working on fixing the problem. Check back soon."" Any calls or chats to the company involve repeated requests from their representatives not to worry: they're working on it. No escalation path is provided, no alternative solutions; if you can't get their link to work, you don't move ahead, and their link doesn't work. Any self-respecting vendor would just send me another phone, but this dystopian giant demands that everyone follow the yellow brick road that leads to a precipice. No wonder people hate google! This is how outsize companies eventually end up being broken up. Edit: It's been a month since I wrote this review, and I've recovered from most of the frustration... Here's how it went: after 7 days, google sorted out it's webpage error, and I was able to return my first phone. Of course, I had to buy a cheap phone in the meantime, to the the tune of about $100. They promptly sent me a second phone (which you have to sign for at home, so have it sent to your place of work!). After about a week, I noticed the front-facing camera didn't work, so I went through the required hour of chat conversation and returned it. The second phone worked otherwise, so it wasn't that big a deal. The third phone arrived, and by this time I am really good at re-installing apps and backups, and this time I actually have the second phone to do it from, so it wasn't too bad. I went on vacation to Paris, and bingo, the third phone dies with a message: ""Slot unbeatable: Load Error"". This is the kiss of death. The phone is now a brick. When I get back from Paris next week, I'll start the return process yet again. Since I now have so much experience with the chat help, I can say that it's not bad (I correct my earlier statement disparaging the chat support), but the phone hardware is apparently garbage (in my experience), so my recommendation is DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM GOOGLE.

No written info, YouTube only.","This is the most disappointing technology purchase I have made in the last several years. And I haven't even had it up yet as a phone or camera. I am seriously debating taking the restock fee hit and returning it. Why? It has an UTTERLY non-standard interface, both for simple charging, and for audio! It has NO! standard headphones jack, nor any simple organizational method for creating a foldesr and putting your apps in them. At least, I can't see where it does. It also DOES NOT HAVE ANY WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION!! NO MANUAL! And forget even an online manual --- all it has is a bunch of stupid, useless **non-searchable** YouTube UNCAPTIONED ""how do you what I think maybe someone somewhere - maybe - might want to do"" videos - and can I return to the NO standard audio interface? The charging cable is non-standard. Not only is the cable non-standard, but the WALL PLUG (AC/DC) adapter is NONSTANDARD. I can't even charge from the DC-DC (""cigarette lighter"") adapter in my car. You will need to buy a special adapter for each and every outlet you want to use in your house. And a SEPARATE, SPECIAL CABLE for each cable you want to have. God forbid you ever travel with this phone: loose your adapter - OR EVEN YOUR CABLE - and you will not be using your phone again until you can get somewhere to receive special orders. Unlike the Apple non-standard adapters and cables, I've never seen either these ""special"" cables or their adapters for sale anywhere. And at least I can plug a non-standard Apple cable into a standard USB adapter. There is no jack for headphones. Or external (""hard-patch"") output to any sound or other source that I can find. I did mention no manual - right? I can only assume Google thinks we all should carry ""blue-tooth bricks"" around with us... but who want to carry heavy blue-tooth headphones in their purse all the time?? Not to mention they are expensive and mine, at least, seem to fail routinely. VERY VERY EXPENSIVE!!!!! To get a headphone for home and one for work and one for the car (for the gym) I'll have an added $150+ expense I had not counted on. It may be that the absence of any manual is the worst thing. I was actually offended by the abysmal quality of the YouTube videos. If I'd wanted to be entertained I'd *go* to YouTube --- not try to get specific, simple ""how in fact can I --- or even can I?? -- make a folder to separate my Spanish from my English from my personal from my work-related apps?"" information. Not to mention simple things like the ... ok, does the only port you do have - the non-standard USB port - output to headphones? And where might I ever get such a thing?? REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD JOB!!!!! NOT something I would have expected from Google. (God forbid I ever actually encounter one of their cars!!!!!!

B0766NJPBN,P. Robichaux,5,"October 29, 2017",False,amazing,"I've had android and iPhone before. There are pro/con's for both but I like Android better. That being said, this phone perfectly exemplifies what Android is supposed to be. Design: I miss the headphone jack. i use corded headphones regularly. That being said, I rarely use the headphone jack and charge the phone at the same time so using the USB-C to 3.5 mm audio adapter hasn't been an issue. An added plus of using the adapter is I no longer have to deal with certain headphone plugs not fitting due to my case not providing a big enough opening. I love that the speakers both face the front.I had adapted a way of holding other phones in a way so that my hand cupped the sound and directed it to my face. No longer needed. Otherwise, the phone is pretty standard as far as premium phones look. You'll likely use a case anyway this isn't really an issue. Performance: There is absolutely no lag in this phone. As soon as you touch a button or spot on the screen, its already where you need to be before the entire weight of your finger crashes down. You can snap photos one after the other and not face any dreaded processing hold screen. OK Google detection is much improved. Not sure if this is due to hardware or software, but I no longer have issues waking my phone up to tell it to create a reminder or something like that. Also, I haven't noticed it responding to others saying OK Google like my previous phone did, but I wasn't on Oreo yet so that could also be why. (but I can't rule out better microphone hardware that might be able to provide better signal to noise ratio) Finger print sensor is lightning fast. Haven't had too many issues with my fingerprint not reading although I did load the same finger twice to get better results. Battery life: With my previous Nexus 5x, if I used the phone (basic stuff like reading news, listening to music, and maybe watching a couple youtube videos/using the maps app) I could maybe make it half a day. With the Pixel 2 after a day of light use I still have 50% battery left. I could likely go 2 days of light use or 1 day of heavy (watching videos) use. Display: The display is absolutely beautiful. The new screen allows for individual pixels to be turned on or off which makes the blacks super dark as there's no backlight. I think this is also why the battery life is so awesome. As a plus, the time, date, temperature, and icons of notification types are able to be displayed on the phone at all times. This is awesome as it makes the phone a true nightstand clock replacement and you can even tell if you missed a text without touching your phone. Camera: Don't get me wrong, the camera is the best I've seen on a phone. But comparing to the Nexus 5x, you don't notice THAT much of a difference.However, with the performance, you can actually take pictures and not have the phone crash on you. Overall, I've been hearing talk of how the pixel 2 still isn't fully complete as in they're missing features, but I can't imagine how necessary they are.

Most of the issues have been worked out except for one HUGE issue. I am unable to maintain a smooth connection on my home WiFi network. I've tried everything and worked with Google support. I get sporadic WiFi connected but has no internet issues constantly. As a result, I am forced to shut down apps or videos several times before things finally reconnect and work again. This also happens on my parent's WiFi. No issues at work or other places. I've also been experiencing text issues the last few weeks, as well. I receive an Error 97: SMS origination denied message when sending texts out. I've spoke to Verizon 4 times and have gone through troubleshooting and they insist there is something wrong with the phone. It has, quite honestly, been maddening.

B0766NJPBN,Mr. Dizzystick,3,"December 18, 2017",False,Did not meet my expectations,"When friends ask me about my Pixel 2, I tell them ""it's all right"". I've been using an iPhone 4 for the past 5 years, so I was looking forward to this phone feeling like a significant upgrade. However, after 2 weeks of using the Pixel 2, it seems my expectations were too high. Compared to iOS, most things on Pixel 2 feel different but rarely better (or worse, to be fair). For example, Google Assistant feels just as limited as Siri - it's only helpful about 20% of the time I use it. Having everything on my phone synced with my web browser (Chrome) is nice, albeit a bit unnerving - I'm constantly reminded about just how much personal information Google has stored. It's cool being able to sign into a site on my phone for the first time using saved login information from my computer, but this feature is a bit inconsistent and does not always work when I expect it to. I like being able to edit notification settings directly from the app icons on my desktop, but overall I feel like I receive far more notifications than I used to on my iPhone (I think because apps on iOS ask upfront if you want notifications whereas on the Pixel 2 you have to seek out these settings). Speaking of notifications, my phone alerted me my cable bill was do in 24 hours - a bill I had already paid a week prior. I think the phone scanned my emails for bill notifications, yet missed the email confirming I paid. Again, I was a bit unnerved that the phone (or Google, or whatever) is scanning my emails. Naive, I know. The camera's nice, though I still get grainy shots when the lighting isn't great (which may be expected?). Camera quality is neither my priority nor something I know much about so I'm unable to say more than pictures look much better than what I used to get on my dated iPhone. I've really only had 1 bad experience so far: I had to download 5-6 different podcast apps to find one that had all of the functionality I was seeking. For whatever reason, Google's default player, Play Music (not to be confused with Play Store, which is a different default app with a similar triangle logo) is missing one of the podcasts I regularly listen to, and a few of the apps I tried that do have this show were missing functionality I wanted. I eventually found an app called Podcast Republic which seems to suit my needs. All in all, it was a hassle to find what I liked, especially compared to iOS where the default podcast player served me so well. One last note: an app (Animal Crossing) stopped working after an update but restarting my phone resolved the issue. Just like a computer, it seems restarting is now the go-to first step in resolving issues, which is certainly manageable but not ideal. Pixel 2 is fine, I slightly regret the purchase mainly because I had such high hopes. I think I would have preferred an iPhone simply for the familiarity (again, I don't feel Android is worse than iOS, I just don't believe the differences are actual improvements).",22.0,Google,"Google Pixel 2 GSM/CDMA Google Unlocked (Clearly White, 64GB, US warranty)"

B0766TPHSH,chris stoltz,4,"February 11, 2018",False,Review of the Google Pixel 2 XL,"I have been using the Google Pixel 2 XL every day for over two months. It is by far the best phone I have used. I will lay out the pros and cons in this review to help you make your decision on whether to purchase this phone. Pros Battery Life - Routinely lasts all day with over 50% remaining, which means that even if you forget to charge up overnight, it will last most of the next day with regular use. Speakers - The Pixel 2 XL features dual front-facing stereo speakers. They provide a fantastic experience while listening to music or watching videos. Camera - The Camera on this phone is one if its biggest selling points. The rear camera is a 12.2 MP sensor with dual LED flash and OIS (optical image stabilization). It is capable of video capture of 2160p at 30fps or 1080p at 120,60, or 30 fps. The front facing camera is an 8 MP sensor capable of 1080p video. The performance in any lighting condition is unmatched by any other flagship smartphone. UI - One of the biggest advantages to owning the Pixel 2 XL is a that it is a Google phone, so you get pure Android with updates as soon as they are published by Google. Cons Audio - The biggest issue with this phone is the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack. This means you will have to rely on the included USB-C to 3.5mm adapter. It is an inconvenience at times and does make it impossible to charge the phone and use wired headphones simultaneously. Screen - The Pixel 2 XL has a 6” P-OLED display at a resolution of 1440x2880 with a pixel density of 538 ppi (pixels per inch). Under most conditions the screen is fantastic, with settings to change the saturation to your liking. The issue is a noticeable blue-shift when viewed at extreme viewing angles that you are unlikely to encounter during regular use. Conclusion The Google Pixel 2 XL is a great phone with enough pros to outweigh the cons. I recommend this phone to anyone looking for an upgrade. Even iPhone users should consider the Pixel if they are interested in Android. While I can’t make any decisions for you, I hope this review helped make that decision easier.",206.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 64GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black
B0766TPHSH,elzilio,5,"April 25, 2018",True,Great battery and camera,"I’ve been using the Pixel 2 XL for a few weeks now. I’m upgrading from a Moto Z I’ve had about a year and a half. There are three main selling points for this phone: Software, camera, and battery. The software is so much more clean and fast than my Moto Z, and most other phones for that matter. Apps all load super quick and I haven’t seen any lag. Apps like Instagram, Google Maps, and Snapchat that used to be slow on my old phone are no longer slow, and games all run smoothly. The camera is probably the best on any phone right now. Every single scene gives me great photos, and it you don’t have to do any manual configuration to get photos to look nice, you just point and shoot. The battery is huge, and is able to last me a full day, from 6:30 AM to 11:00 PM without any issues. A fast charger is included in the box for quick top ups, and since it's USB-C, I can use my MacBook charger if I need to. Other things I like are the squeeze for Google Assistant, which sounds like a gimmick but I actually really like it. The front facing speakers are nice and loud, and the hardware feels very well built. I’m a little disappointed there isn't any wireless charging, but thats certainly not a deal breaker. Some of the cons of this phone are the lack of a headphone jack, and a good always on display. The headphone jack isn’t a huge issue for me, since I mostly use bluetooth, but the always on display is terrible compared to Motorola’s. You can’t just wave your hand to turn it on, you can't touch to view more details on the notification, and it can be slow to activate sometimes. Overall, this phone is a great upgrade from my Moto Z.

Definitely what I expected in paying for the Pixel 2 XL. I was looking for a relatively affordable but quality smartphone which cost isn't 4 digits. Phone came out great out-of-the-box. There are two reasons why I'm returning this phone. It has been about a month since I received the phone. I was very impressed and satisfied with the purchase until yesterday. There were minor issues beforehand but none that seemed as significant until it came to the problem where my touch screen for the lower half of my phone was unresponsive in understanding my touch input. When checking the Amazon price, I noticed that the price was $130 less ($529 as of writing this review vs $659 of ordering this phone about a month apart) Amazon directed me to call Google directly and per the Google's troubleshooting, resetting into Safe Mode is not enough to fix it, which makes me suspect this is a hardware issue with the specific phone. The Google technical support representative indicated to try resetting to safe mode, which did not work, further reinforcing my belief that this particular phone I had has a digitizer issue. I'm comfortable with replacing my own screen, but for the bang of my buck, which is what I prioritized. For $529, I'd rather just get the 3A XL with preferred care from Google for $40 more, especially considering I spent about $100 more for just this particular phone), I don't really need all the specs that the Pixel 2 XL provides and a comparable (still very quality) battery life.

B0766TPHSH,Jeffrey,5,"May 16, 2019",True,Affordable like the pixel 3a but with the benefits of the the pixel 3.,"I love this phone. I got it after the pixel 3 came out. From what I was researching before, it's pretty much the 3 only missing some minor things. When it came down to it, this was more affordable and only came with only a little less than a pixel 3 phone. The only downside is that now the 3a is out and it has a headphone jack, but way less things when it comes to hardware. The pixel 2 is waterproof, and has the metal body while the 3a has the plastic body and no water resistance. Haven't had a 3a myself but that's kind of a deal breaker to me considering the phone.

Also there's a word graininess to the display that's overlayed on everything. Very subtle but still there. Thses issues are somewhat glaring but you will get used to them and forget about them.

As of today, I no longer have use of my phone and will have to pay to have it repaired, I'm guessing that will cost a bit. I did purchase insurance with Verizon, a refurbished phone that they will send me will cost me $199 for the deductible. I paid over $800 for the phone!!!! I expected it to last longer than 14 months. My Windows phone lasted me over four years, as did the phone before that one. I take very good care of electronics. I can also add, before today, I raved about this phone. Everything about it was awesome. Now it is just dead. Having all these great features is not worth it if a charging port can't be built well.

B0766TPHSH,Harish,5,"March 20, 2018",False,Best smartphone of this Era!,"After using a long lineup of devices manufactured by apple, this particular model manufacture by Google made me so curious. The best camera phone I have ever owned and the Lumia 1020 comes close to this. Google has made justification to thus device by providing timely security updates and they keep this phone buttery smooth. Google Assistant on this phone does wonders and for some particular reason it is super responsive and I can say that it is better than Siri (sorry girl) the battery life on this phone is excellent and it can take on hard hitting. I always play the Asphalt xtreme, into the dead two, shadowgun and shellrazer and this phone never ceases to amaze me, as the battery percentage does not drop drastically like some other phones. If you start with a 100% on a morning and with light to moderate usage, the 3520 mAh battery can make you take this phone to your work on the next day, trust me! Coming to the portrait modes on the front and rear cameras, man they are great. The machine learning on this phone on a whole new level as it learns continuously on the areas it needs to keep out of focus and unlike the iPhone X the front camera detects ears and hair pretty well. The only thing which I do not like about this phone is that it does not have a 3.5 mm headphone jack. The power button the panda version which I have is truly spectacular and the colored power buttons on smartphones have become a thing now. The front facing speakers on this phone are loud and it is great to have this since the last ones which i had tried was on the HTC one M7. To sum up this review, the Google pixel 2 XL is an excellent phone if you are willing to pay a good sum of money and trust me, you will not be disappointed at all.",5.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 64GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black
B0766TPHSH,Jocilyn Wagner,5,"July 7, 2018",False,Probably the best phone I've ever owned,"I've been using the Pixel 2 XL Unlocked (from Project Fi) for a couple days shy of 6 months and it's probably been the best phone I've ever owned. I never bought a case for it as they were too expensive and simply threw it into the middle slot in my clutch everyday. I just cleaned the screen and there zero blemishes, with some very minor scratches on one edge of the rear glass. Waterproofing is excellent (I've done quite a bit of photography during thunderstorms) as is the camera for virtually anything i'd need to shoot not requiring a DSLR. The operating system has been updated three times to Android P Beta 3 and all versions have simply flown. I've tried most of the features excepting some of the less-secure smart unlock features. My only complaint is that the screen reader is all but worthless unless you're legit blind and have used multiple Android phones previously. Compared to the iPhone's screen reader, which i've used every night for the past five years to turn fanfics into audiobooks, Android's screen reader may as well be bloatware. Speaking of bloatware, there isn't any and nearly every app i've ever installed has run smooth as butter. I have tried installing 3rd party launchers and at least the Windows Phone launcher works well for what it is, though i can't imagine a need for them. Just now my phone rang and it recognized it as a suspected spam caller and didn't alert me. Battery life is really quite excellent if you follow the battery-saving steps recommended in the settings. Today i shot and then edited about 10 photos in Snapseed and uploaded them and had only lost about 8% power when I was done. Under normal/standby usage i usually get four-five days. Under heavy usage, about three. The always-on screen is terrific and well-designed to be read in any light. The Now Playing feature that Google used to advertise this phone works maybe 5% of the time? The concept needs work and the offline micro-database powering it is too small to be useful for any style of music. The biometric sensors are terrific and if you take your phone with you everywhere you'll never have to ""start a workout"" and still have excellent statistics (I recommend exporting them to Exist.io as the Google Fit app is designed for the lowest common denominator with little functionality). I have no use for VR and haven't used any of those features, but there are so many crammed in that this phone would be an excellent choice if you needed to. Occasionally for some reason i manage to accidentally switch on speakerphone and i'm not sure why but i doubt it's a real bug. 100% recommended. I can't imagine what Google would have to do to top this.",2.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 64GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black

B0766TPHSH,CaedenV,5,"May 4, 2019",True,Great phone!!!!,"I am what you may call a 'value tech enthusiast'. I love computers, and AV equipment, and phones, and networking... if it required power and has a screen or makes noise then I will probably love it. However, I learned a long time ago that electronics only live for so long before they break, are broken, or outdated, and generally need to be replaced, so I find it very difficult to spend lots of money on things like phones, tvs, speakers, etc. if I am just going to replace it all a few years later anyways. This device is a great value! Especially certified refurbished which brought it down to ~$350. At a year old, it still gets all of the current updates, and it still has one of the best cameras on the market. Nice large display, great battery life for normal non-gaming use (videos, pictures, podcasts, music, email, text, and the occasional phone call). Plus, we moved over to Google Fi service with these phones, and that has also been fantastic! As we are not heavy data users our monthly savings will pay off both phones within 2 years, Plus the data is there if we do need it while on a trip. There are a few things that I don't care for: While large, and with good battery life, it is quite heavy if you use it a lot; consider getting a ring or poper to help support it or lean it upright while using it. The lack of headphone jack is quite annoying. We have not picked up any decent BT headphones, the one I have falls out of my ears constantly, and we have lots and lots of traditional in-ear and over-ear headphones, but can never find the adapter when we need it, and if you use it in your pocket with the adapter, it falls out, or goes off-kilter which stops your music and causes no end of issues. We will get good BT headphones eventually... but man is it annoying. The display is great on-axis, but does color shift quickly if you are off-axis at all. For normal use I do not see this as a real issue, but if you prop it up and watch videos I could see this being super annoying. But other than those 3 things, everything else has been great! No notch, decent speakers, good fingerprint reader, great camera and display, solid battery life... considering all of the pros and cons compared to other devices, I think I still would have chosen this even at a higher price point... and the fact that it isn't at a higher price point is just a bonus!

BUT there are a plethora of good battery pack cases for the Pixel 2 (and 3!) and I use it extensively, which renders the pixel's horrible battery life moot (the battery case's battery is bigger than the onboard battery, so I have 2x+ battery life by default).

Quite frankly, my biggest thing is having a system that doesn't freeze and doesn't take forever to load information. My other primary issues with phones are the speakers. I think most companies focus so much on the Camera that the speakers are often neglected. The pixel 2 for filled both of my primary needs. The absolute smoothly and quickly, as well as the internet. It's two front-facing speakers make it handy for using speakerphone or for playing music.

And ALL Pixel 2 phones are unlocked. But it came in a box that had ""CDMA"" printed in large letters, which confused me. And it had a Verizon SIM card already in its SIM slot. I thought that I could just bring it to a Sprint store and let them activate this phone. The phone number that I wished to use was already with Sprint (CDMA). But that was a complete fiasco that lasted three hours. At that point, I came very close to returning the phone. But I picked up a Consumer Cellular SIM card (GSM) from Target. Over the phone, Consumer Cellular ported the phone number from Sprint in a matter of seconds, activated the SIM card, and helped me manually enter the special strings needed to enable Internet over their data connection.

POLED is a cheaper form of AMOLED panel because it uses a plastic layer instead of glass. Not sure why Google made the decision to go that route on a phone this expensive. In any case, I noticed burn-in along the navigation bar after less than a year even though I had brightness at 50 percent. When viewing the screen at a slight angle, there is a blueish hue on the panel. Google acknowledged the problem and supposedly worked out an assembly line fix with LG (the maker of the phone). Apparently phones made before a certain date are affected. Again, unacceptable for a flagship-priced phone. Note that the smaller Pixel 2 doesn't seem to have the same issues.

B0766TPHSH,Joshua,5,"March 26, 2018",False,"Excellent phone, but a bit fragile and slightly grainy image in VR","This would be a 4.5 star review, but Amazon doesn't do partial stars, so I'm rounding up. Got one of these just over a week ago after my old Nexus 5X took a swim. (No big deal, I needed to replace it eventually anyhow, I guess.) So, first off, let's start with the bad things I've noticed so far: - Fragile. This thing is glass front and back, and a direct hit on a solid surface could crack and/or shatter it pretty easily. (In fact, this happened to mine on day 2, but I was fortunate enough to get the screen replaced the same day.) - Slippery. The phone itself doesn't have a lot of grip directly (part of what led to it taking a spill on day 2). (Note that I've since resolved both of these issues by putting it in a protective case, and have not had issues since. I'm not deducting any stars for this.) - Slightly grainy images. I didn't really notice this until I started using the phone for VR, at which point it became obvious at first, and within a few minutes I forgot about it. (This is my half-star deduction.) Now that that's over, let's talk about the good: - Battery life is fantastic. If I'm not abusing VR (how to kill your phone battery 101)...this easily lasts a day, even under moderately heavy use. (If I'm abusing VR, I have a charger nearby, but it can still go a few hours.) - Volume is fantastic. - Phone is fast, and other than the graininess mentioned above (that I only even noticed in VR)....picture looks good as well. - Is apparently water resistant (although I'm not testing this) Finally, the ""could be better, but not quite 'bad'"": - No SD card slot (why phone makers moved away from this idk) - No removable battery - No wireless charging - No headphone jack (bluetooth works great, though)",2.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 64GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black

B0766TPHSH,Alex,5,"March 28, 2018",False,Amazing phone (long review),"So I got the Panda version (white and black) and not from Amazon. I started off with the kinda blue Pixel 2 but the 5"" screen was driving me crazy. The 6"" screen is perfect. To first cover on complaints about the screen, I got mine a few weeks ago so it's after all the updates that Google did to fix the complaints that was happening with the screen. Personally, I think it's gorgeous and it's one of the many reasons I love this phone. DISPLAY - The 18:9 aspect ratio is amazing. Simple as that. It makes the screen so much bigger without having such a large phone. It's still a rather large phone but it's a lot easier to handle because it's not compensating for the large bezels. The rounded corners add such a nice flair. Everything just looks so clean. After the update, Google added multiple color choices including Natural (all colors are kind of darker but more true to life), Boosted (again, pretty dark but a little bit more vibrant) and Saturated (if you like Samsung displays, you'll love this) PERFORMANCE - This thing screams. A lot of phones are coming out with 6 gigs of RAM, 8 gigs of RAM. This destroys the competition with only 4 gigs of RAM. Even when I owned the smaller version, I haven't found a single app or game that chokes it up. It multitasks like a boss and with the latest version of Android every time it hits, you can't ask for much more UPDATES - I figured I would cover this now because of how I ended the last bit. This is a straight from Google phone so you're guaranteed the latest updates for 2 years with security updates for 3 years. It's nice having instant access to the latest update and knowing you're going to continue to get them immediately on release for 2 years. I've owned a few Motorola phones and some of them I've had to wait for up to 10 months before I got the latest. This is instant. I know it's something Apple fans have enjoyed since the beginning but it's a nice feeling BATTERY LIFE - I haven't personally experienced any god-like battery life from this device. It's matched what I expect out of a smart phone which is let me make it through an entire day with moderate use without dying. Some people are getting a day out of it with like 8-9 hours of on screen time. I haven't had the pleasure of this occurring yet for me. I usually make it with 2 1/2 hours of on screen time and the battery at 25-30% before I head to bed. This is good enough for me though. I used to have to top off the 5"" Pixel 2 around noon to make sure it lasted the rest of the day. I haven't used my in car charger since I got the XL CAMERA - They always say to save the best for last. This is an understatement for the camera. All you've heard about the camera, it's not an exaggeration. It lives up to all the hype. Pictures take quickly. A few seconds of processing in the back ground and it looks like pro material. I've taken pictures without looking and been amazed at the clarity and detail every single shot. I haven't done too many videos but they record in 4K with optical and software stabilization. I tested this briefly by just running across a room and the final product made it look like I was gliding across the room. Also, if you're a pixel user, you get unlimited storage at full resolution on Google Photos up until 2020. Which is also pretty nice. I've attached a picture of my cat as an example of how good the photos are In conclusion, this phone is worth every penny. If you don't like the XL, you can go with the standard Pixel 2 and get the same features, performance and camera. Just a smaller screen and smaller battery. This phone is absolutely incredible and lives up if not exceeds every expectation",2.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 64GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black
B0766TPHSH,R. Perkins,2,"April 2, 2018",False,unimpressive for the price,"I was unimpressed with this phone and returned it after 1 day of use. It wasn't that it was a terrible phone, but it felt to me like a phone of half the price masquerading as a top-shelf product. It just isn't. It didn't compare well to my 2+ year old Motorola Droid Turbo, which I switched back to and am still using. Here were the issues I had: - The screen was low quality by several metrics. This is by far the worst thing about this phone. It's reasonably HD in terms of pixel count, but the colors were noticeably more drab and less vibrant than on my droid turbo. Also, for some reason a bunch of images that look super crisp and wonderful on my droid looked pixelly on this phone (I guess hence the name 'pixel'). This wasn't just due to the difference in pixel density either. And here's the worst part: the screen is grainy, as others have complained about. You notice it more on light colors like webpage backgrounds, but it's everywhere. It looks like everything, and I mean everything, has a papery texture to it. I guess this could be a plus for a select few people, but to me it indicates a lower quality screen and could be pretty maddening. Finally, also as others have noticed, it has a pretty strong blue tint at an angle. Not a deal breaker for me on its own, but combined these all make for a pretty crappy screen. Worse than any other phone I've previously owned. - The camera (which is billed as a highlight) just wasn’t that good. Again, the photos on my droid turbo look crisper and the colors look better. What’s all the hype about? Thoroughly unimpressed. - No headphone jack is a big turnoff for me. It comes with an adapter, but it’s long and the connection is not that solid, and it goes into the bottom of the phone so it’s going to be upside down if it’s in your pocket. - It’s pretty plain jane as far as features go. There’s simply not that much to recommend it. A very ‘vanilla’ phone for such a hefty price. The fingerprint recognition to unlock is a nice touch, though the angle of it is awkward when you’re actually holding the phone. On-screen fingerprint recognition would be ideal. All in all, if this phone were priced half of what it currently is, I think it’d be a decent buy. As is, I really don’t know what the hype is about.

Once the person on the other end of the line sounded unintelligible. I never had this problem with the Iphone, so when I went back to the Verizon store (45 min). They asked my if I would trade it in and a new pixel phone and that I probably had a bad phone.

B0766TPHSH,Hors D'oeuvre,1,"March 7, 2018",False,A Regression from the Progress of the Nexus 6,"Was a Nexus 6 user for four years, and this device feels like many steps back. First and foremost, that display. Looks downright crumby next to a Samsung panel, but the look actually bothered me less than the feel. The screen feels thin and hollow like there's an air bubble trapped behind it. Lo and behold, according to some experts, this is probably due to an inexperienced maker working with Gorilla Glass for the first time. This was enough for me to return the phone within 5 days. Aside from the problematic display, there's no wireless charging and no headphone jack. How is this possible? My 4-year-senior Nexus 6 had a better feel, a headphone jack, and wireless charging! Aren't devices supposed to get better over time? Never thought I'd say it, but now I'm the proud owner of a Samsung. The lack of ""pure android,"" which seems increasingly spy-like, was a reasonable trade-off to retain the feel of a high-quality device, and useful features that are not obsolete. What good are the best photographs if you can't appreciate them with the display? Oh right, Google is connecting the dots between your photographs and your location (against your will) in order to build a VR map of the world. They need an army of really good cameras out there in order to do that successfully. OK, now I'm rambling. The Pixel 2 XL feels like a step back in time from the Nexus 6.

How is this acceptable in 2017 for a phone that costs nearly a thousand dollars?! The screen vibrates with an annoying rattle if you play audio. The glass is curved and there are no decent screen protectors for it. Scrolling content causes it to smear across the screen, making it illegible - you have to completely stop scrolling to read anything clearly. No headphone jack. The squeeze gimmick is useless. Buttons fall off - how does that impact water resistance?! Incredibly slow fast-charging, it takes 2x as long as my Nexus 6P to charge. It does have excellent battery life... That's the only standout feature though. I do not recommend the Pixel 2 XL... it's a very mediocre phone that is extremely overpriced.

B0767538YH,D.Z,1,"May 1, 2018",True,"Charge port failed after two months, google refuses to replace due to large scratch on back","Negatives: The USB-C charge port gradually started failing. Then it refused to charge at all via power devliery (thats what the official ac adapter it comes with uses to charge quickly). So, I plugged it into a regular usb port and it would charge from there. Then a few days later it wouldnt charge and I smelled a burning smell coming from the usbc port. It was connected to a regular usb port, which had no problem charging any of my other devices perfectly and reliably and it was an anker product not some weird chinese deal. From that point on I havent been able to charge the phone. I contacted google for warranty replacement, they requested pictures of front and back of phone. Since I had dropped the phone before there was a ding near the top of the phone (was TOTALLY unrelated to the charging issues). Google support said that since there appeared to be a tiny crack, not just a ding, that it was no longer covered under warranty and that I was SOL. I bought this phone along with the pixelbook, whose trackpad failed within a month of purchase (see that review). I have tons of gadgets and I dont remember having ANY hardware failures ever! DO NOT BUY GOOGLE HARDWARE the quality control is awful and they have silly excuses ready to get out of warranty replacement. (again see my pixelbook review). I also got the pixelbuds, another crappy product. (Exception: Google Wifi was actually a great product, best router ever- go figure.) So after two months I have a really expensive brick that cannot be charged. Other issues I had: From day one I was never able to easily get multiple large files off the device, not sure if that is a software or hardware issue. It would fail during the process of copying files to any type of usb c drive or memory card reader (tried several). So getting large video files off the device was a painstaking process of copying a few at a time, waiting for those to complete, then copying a few more. I even tried copying using a chormebook connected to phone via usb c and that copying process would also sometimes fail. Since google refuses to include micro sd cards, that option for file transfer is also gone. Battery life was about standard for current phones, definitely wouldnt leave the house without a charger. (On the other hand, the keyone black edition Im using now I dont even think about bringing a charger, even I have trouble running that battery all the way down in a day of heavy usage). When used with a daydream headset to watch videos, after about an hour or two the phone would get too hot and I would be requested by daydream notifications to stop using vr mode while the phone cools down. So as a video watching device with daydream, the product fails.(Eagerly awaiting the Oculus Go) The navigation buttons use unnecessary screen real estate with no official option to hide or turn off or replace with gestures, although I read there is a work around, but I didnt want any issues so I didnt use the workaround. Huawei and Samsung phones don't waste screen space with unneeded onscreen buttons. Positives: The phone works with Project FI. That is the main reason I got the phone. Project Fi is fantastic, especially for travelers. Fortunately, I can stay on the project Fi plan and keep using data only sims in reliable phones even with a dead pixel 2 XL brick. (Although I dont seem to be able to forward calls to non U.S. numbers, which is a bummer when traveling, especially when the phone itself is broken) Super smooth performance and stock google, best camera ever, all apps work really well on it.

B0767538YH,Trevor,2,"April 25, 2018",True,I Got a Dud.,"I was *really* excited to finally get the Pixel 2. I can't stand big phones but got a great deal on an unused open box 2XL. As soon as I opened the box, I could tell right away the 2XL wasn't going to work out but I thought maybe I would get used to it. Until I turned it on. The blue shift was severe. I should mention that I obsessively research any big expense (cars, electronics, phones, etc.) before purchasing so I knew all about the issues with the 2XL. A lot of people said some of these phones didn't have the blue shift, that some had a warmer color screen, that phones with the blue shift weren't as bad as people made it out to be. I'm a very laid back guy who doesn't need the highest resolution screen or all the bells and whistles but the blue shift on this particular phone was crazy. If I turned it just slightly, no more than 5-10 degrees, it was there. Like so many people, I expect better from a phone that originally cost $950. My cheapo AT&T GoPhone (Samsung Galaxy Express Prime, $50 new from Walmart) had a better viewing angle than this particular Pixel 2XL. Now as I said, NOT ALL PIXEL 2XL PHONES HAVE THIS PROBLEM. There are countless internet articles and forums detailing this. Some have an amazing screen and others have a dud like the one I received. Had there not been any screen issues, I could have gotten used to the overall size of the phone. I didn't use this phone long enough to form an opinion about its performance.

B0767538YH,E Clay,3,"March 23, 2018",False,I love my Pixel 2 XL,"Well???? I love my Pixel 2 XL. I have had this phone for less than 2 weeks since I made the MAJOR investment in purchase this ($900 something). I got it in a timely fashion. Right out of the box I was impressed. I love the single lens camera look and the fingerprint sensor on the back. Where it should be. After doing a battery drain and charging it back up to 100% I began to us it and I am very impressed. It seems quicker/snappier than its predecessors. The real selling point is the PURE Android experience. It doesn’t have the ads and extra apps like Facebook, Uber, IHeart Radio and Carrier Apps. It only comes with 21 (last I counted) pre-installed apps. On my old phone I jail broke/ rooted it to get the features to do what this phone already comes with. Like killing apps in the back ground and limiting permissions on what apps can have access to. (Why does the calculator need access to your phone book???) Also, the battery life is OUTSTANDING. I tend to use my phone for my business which makes it my second most important tool for what I do. I will have it fully charged at 6:30 in the morning with heavy use during the day. It will still be around 20% at 8 o’clock that night. The automatic music identifier is a great touch as is the camera. I have taken a lot of pics with it and this is the absolute best I’ve ever used or seen. For the average user like me I will never get the full use out of it but, it is good to know it is there. One of the few things I am disappointed about is the Google Photos. I am not good with how it tries to identify everyone in the pics and try to ask you their names. Which it send your photos to the Google Cloud. At this point I feel like I am feeding the “Beast”. So I use a third party app for my photos. Another problem that I had was in the first 72 hours my phone kept saying that Google has stopped. Nothing worked after that. I turned it on and off and it still was doing the same thing. I checked for an update which there was and it took care of the problem. But, my real problem is with Google themselves. Two weeks after I bought my phone the prices dropped by $200. So I called and inquired about getting in on this deal and they said that I would have to return my phone and order a new one. First of all, who does that? For an older person like me it takes 3 days to get my phone just the way I want it. So this would mean I would have to put my info back on my old phone (Nexus 6) then transfer it again when I get my new phone. That is just too much trouble. So if I return it they can keep it. I will just get a Xiaomi Mi Mix 2s. It’s still $200 cheaper with the discount that Google is giving. I am very disappointed in how Google is handling my situation. I’m pretty sure I am going to return it because it is the principle of it. But, still I refuse to go to Apple due to their control freak OS and I will go back to a flip phone before going to a Samsung. Also, they didn’t send me a survey after I hung up on them",2.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 128GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black
B0767538YH,Michaelle Bown,5,"February 9, 2018",False,Best Phone I've Used,"I’ve had the Google Pixel 2 XL for about two months now, and I can honestly say that it is the best phone that I have ever had, and that’s coming from an Apple enthusiast. I bought the 2 XL after having owned the IPhone 4 and 5s. Apples IPhone’s don’t even compare to Google’s Pixel 2 XL, and here’s why. Let’s start with the screen. Sporting the latest OLED panel made by Samsung, the Pixel 2 XL can achieve some of the darkest blacks and brightest whites on the market. Due to the massive 6.2-inch OLED screen, a bluish haze can appear, which is a common problem with OLED screens. Honestly, it’s not very noticeable unless you are really looking for it. Today’s smartphones are becoming bezelless, meaning the front of the phone is virtually all usable screen (see picture below). The Pixel 2’s small bezels are only necessary because of two front-facing speakers that honestly sound crystal clear. They can reach high volumes without distortion, and for someone like me who watches to a lot of YouTube videos and listens to music, I prefer the stereo speakers. The Pixel 2 XL is one of the quickest and most responsive phones on the market. Because Google uses stock Android, paired with 8.1.0 Oreo, opening and closing apps is seamless. Typing gives a very satisfying vibrate and click noise with no lag giving the user a “taptic” feeling. Google Assistant is perfected with the new squeeze function, allowing for the quickest Google searches on any smart device. The rear located fingerprint sensor is placed right where the user’s pointer finger rests, unlocking the phone within the blink of an eye. Supplying power to this device Is one of the biggest batteries ever put into a smartphone. The quick charge of the 3520mAh allows for 7 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes! In total, I can get about 13 hours on a full charge with about 7 and a half hours of screen-on-time, which is an industry leading statistic! To be honest, I don’t take a whole lot of pictures, but that’s the Pixel 2’s bread and butter. Taking DSL quality pictures with only ONE rear-facing camera is one of the coolest aspects of this phone. Competitors like the Nexus 6P, Galaxy S8 Plus, and IPhone 10 all use a dual lens setup to allow for clear field of depth photos. The Pixel 2 XL’s single-camera does the exact same thing as the competitors, but better. Using software, which in my opinion looks 10 times better than a dual lens setup. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get away from the “Apple hype” but not necessarily transition straight into an android phone. The Pixel 2 Xl is the best of both worlds when it comes to merging the simplicity of an IOS operating system (Apple’s IPhone), and the customizable features of an Android (Samsung’s Galaxy 8) that the phone just feels pretty much perfect. Overall the Pixel 2 XL does everything an IPhone or Samsung does, but better. The screen is arguably the only downside due to the bluing issue; however, the software, google assistant, battery life, camera, and design make the Pixel 2 XL stand out in today’s smartphone market.",5.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 128GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black

B0767538YH,Mike S,1,"July 8, 2019",False,This is the worst cell phone ever,"My wife and I have had our Pixel 2XL phones for a year. They have had minor inconveniences through out the entire year. I am just now writing to you here because I am getting NOWHERE with Google help desk. Here is my problems for both phones. There have been several times they wouldn't connect to any WiFi router and then I noticed that some of the apps were running very slow. It seems that after a factory update (at least every other one it seems) I need to reset our phones totally and use the backup to reinstall everything back on the phones. The phones will automatically restart with NO action asking for it. Now my biggest issue with my phone is that it is now taking over 10 hours to charge from 57% battery. I have a screen shot of it telling me that it is going to take 15 hours to charge from 10%. I have already tried cleaning out the charging port, and going through the Google automated line. Lets just say that after going through all the steps to try and fix the problem, it left my phone in safe mode. I had to yet again reset my phone. I called and finally spoke to a human being that could not speak English very well, but he manged to tell me that I needed to give Google my phone and they would see why it was acting the way it is. Oh, did I mention that that process was going to take 7 to 10 days? We use our phones for work purposes and cannot be without them that long. Again, I have contacted Google about my phone and not my wife's phone directly because of the issues we are having. I figured if I could get the fix on my phone, than I could use the same fix on hers. By this time, we just want to get away from these Pixel phones. In short, THESE THE WORST PHONES I HAVE EVER OWNED. I have been on a cell phone of one kind or another for over 20 years. We were talked into them and have not liked them the entire time we have had them. The customer service for Google is good, but they are more worried about making sure their product is seen in a good light instead of helping the actual customer out.

B0767538YH,rbty,2,"December 17, 2017",False,Doesn't deliver on promises.,"Sorry to review this on Amazon, but I purchased my Pixel 2 xl from Project Fi and they don't provide a method for review ANYWHERE. Wanted to love this phone so much that I waited months after placing my order for it to ship. The bells and whistle, super camera, sleek design, Squeeze to activate assistant, etc. were super exciting, but I really wanted something with killer basic features too. My 4 1/2 year old Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was awesome, but just getting old, not holding a charge and suffering from screen burn in. First off, out of the box = the eSim set up (for Project Fi )seems cool but tons of stuff doesn't transfer - phone contacts, etc. took an extra step. So it's only somewhat cool as a way to set it up. Was looking forward to setting up Android Pay and using my phone to pay, couldn't reliably set up my old phone to do that, but to set up Android Pay you are required to use one of the Lock features for the phone, which makes perfect sense. I chose Smartlock using a numerical code as the setup procedure recommends that as the most secure. Then I set my home as a Trusted Place so that I wouldn't have to unlock the device every time I picked it up at home. This feature doesn't really work and, since trying to set it up, I've found many complaints about this among reviewers. When leaving my home the lock feature is supposed to activate. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. This means that if I lose my phone at the store, I'm potentially leaving a non-passwd protected credit card laying around for anyone to use. When I return to my home the ""trusted place' feature always works once - the first time I use the phone after arriving. Every time after that the phone no longer recognizes that it is in the 'trusted place' and I have to unlock it. I was REALLY sucked in by all the ads for how fast this phone charges. Absolutely not. I plugged my phone in at 9:50 pm with an 8% charge, and it reached 100% at 12:20 - 2 1/2 hours later. That is much slower than my 4 1/2 year old Samsung phone, which can still charge fully from a 4% charge in 45 to 50 minutes. This is an absolute fail as far as I'm concerned. Many people complain about the blue tint of the screen when not looking at the screen dead on. It's there, but for some reason doesn't bother me. I DON'T tilt my screen. But I'm not watching movies on the phone, so don't know if it would be a pain under other circumstances. Haven't explored the camera features. Don't want to fall in love with them till I know if I'm keeping the phone. Would have liked to see a future when I could charge this phone cordlessly. Thought everybody was doing that now, but, apparently that will never happen with this phone. When I called Google customer support to get help with my complaints - hoping they were just problems with settings - the rep was super friendly but basically admitted that Project Fi and Pixel phones are ""works in progress"". Her words. That 'everything is beta' mentality of Google's is fine for free ChromeOS on my $250 Chromebook, but for a phone that cost $850 on a network that doesn't deliver on it's central promise (cheap and agile), it's not cool.",30.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 128GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black

B0767538YH,N.Yorker,5,"November 24, 2017",False,There's NOTHING better out there.,"I've had the Pixel XL 2 for almost a month now, and can conclusively say it is the best phone I have ever used. My previous phones in order of last use: Note 8, iPhone 7, HTC 10, S7 edge, Nexus 6P, etc. Of all my previous phones, the Pixel XL 2 reminds me the most of the 6P, but it supersedes it in every category. Screen 8.5: There is a lot of commentary about how awful this screen is that you'd think it was unusable or caused blindness. That couldn't be further from the truth. This OLED screen is gorgeous. Blacks are pitch black, so contrast is infinite. Images pop in saturated mode just like any Samsung OLED screen, but saturated mode looks awful just like Samsung screens do. Those colors aren't real. You have three color modes: natural (sRGB), boosted and saturated. If you want a near-perfect accurate screen in sRGB mode, this screen will give you that. If you want saturation, now you have the option also. As for screen grain and uneven distribution of colors, those are defects. Return your phone for an exchange if you see any of that. I'm coming from a Note 8, and I honestly only notice ONE difference between the two screens: brightness. The Note 8 was much brighter outside. But indoors, I have the exact same experience. Responsiveness 10: Most responsive phone in existence. Shames the Note 8 with 6GB of RAM. I even find it smoother than the latest iPhone 8. Google is up to something here, and it shows. I've gone through a lot of phones in the last 3 years, and this is the first month I've spent with a phone where I did not want to immediately go back to a previous device. I tap, things open. I click home, and things close. Immediately. No hangs. No stutters. No nonsense. I don't do games. So pretty much all my apps stay in memory, and multi-tasking is immediate. If you game, you'll find yourself reloading since there is only 4gigs of ram here. Software 10: There is no smarter phone out there. It is simple, unobtrusive, quick, responsive, right when you need it and beautiful. Very iPhone-like. But it outdoes Apple in ways I never thought possible. Google assistant tells you your commute right when you get up, and it responds by a simple squeeze. You can unlock the phone by saying: ""Ok Google."" It unlocks by your voice only, so it's safe. At this point, I find every single google offering better than what apple has on their iPhones: google docs, google music, google photos, etc. Camera 10: The camera is a bit ridiculous. It is just mind-boggling how much better this camera is compared to everything else out there. It is a simple point and shoot. No dual camera. No manual controls except for exposure level. But the amount of detail on the images is stunning. The pictures look very ""PixelESQUE."" I know immediately if I'm looking at a Pixel shot due to the sheer amount of detail. The Note 8 photos I shoot look soft and extremely saturated compared to everything that comes out of the Pixel 2 XL. Google is already THE LEADER without a second camera, if they add a second lens next year, the competition is in for some work. Battery Life 10: I'm getting around 6-7 hours of screen on time with 13-16 hours in between charges. I have NEVER had this type of battery with a phone. Usage differs between users, so those stats don't mean much for other people. The Pixel 2 XL also comes with first-of-a-kind tech on Android where battery adapts to the user and reports accurate battery life based on usage. It learns your patterns. This is the definition of a smartphone. If you want the best phone out there right now, you have three options: iPhone 8Plus/X, Note 8 and the Pixel XL 2. In my experience, the only thing these phones have that are superior to the Pixel line is the screen. But it is not the enormous difference people are making it out to be. It is the difference between a perfect 10 to an 8.5, and I only give the Pixel XL 2 a score of an 8 because it is technically inferior: it turns bluer than the competition at slighter angles, it is less bright, it suffers from black smearing when the screen is at 0% brightness, etc. These problems are technical for a reason. You don't notice them unless you're looking for them. The great majority of users do not look at images at angles or measure light deviations at angle intervals; most people do not use their phones at 0% brightness, and if they do, it is most likely a quick exercise. If you're hesitant about purchasing this phone due to screen issues, do not be.

B0767538YH,Gao Atamazon,5,"November 19, 2018",False,Finally a perfect phone,"A disclaimer: I did not buy the phone here. I bought it used on eBay. So this review is only for the product itself, and had nothing to do with the seller. I had the original Pixel XL and waited for Pixel XL 3. When it finally came out, I was disappointed. No battery life improvement (in fact, it dropped down from Pixel XL 2 according to reviews), and there is that obnoxious notch, even a double notch sometimes. Big turnoffs. So I went ahead to get a used Pixel XL 2 instead. I'm very satisfied. The original Pixel XL was already a great phone. But Pixel XL 2 is about perfect. To me, besides the Pixel line, there is no other option anyway. Reason 1: With Gogle Fi which provides the first and only global network service, the Pixel is really the only global phone. Just travel to another country with an Android phone on Google Fi, and you will understand what I mean by this. Reason 2: I don't want an Apple. And I don't want any third-party renditions of Android either, including Samsung and Huawei, because although they make great hardware, they always manage to damage the true Android experience, both in the user interface and the speed and availability of updates. The only problems I had with the original Pixel XL was that (1) I was running out of storage on the 32 GB; (2) I was desiring a little bit better battery life so it would be able to run through a busy day reliably and comfortably. Better battery life is always desirable. The original Pixel XL had difficulties to last a whole day of heavy use. Even though it is fine 95% of time, just an occasional occurrence of out-of-battery at the end of day is painful enough. As one would be habitually recharging the phone at end of day anyway, at least a whole-day battery life is critically important. Pixel XL 2 solved both problems. In addition, it also has a few nice features that the original Pixel did not have: (1) it has eSIM and can be activated without a physical SIM if you're using Google's Fi network. You can actually insert a physical SIM of an alternative network, but I found that switching back and forth is almost impractical, although possible. Every time when you switch to the physical SIM network, returning back to eSIM would require you to reactivate with Google. Sure reactivation was quite simple, involving just a few clicks, but still it is far from being seamless, and you shouldn't mistake this as a dual-SIM phone. (2) Carriers like Verizon have stopped locking Pixel 2 phones. So you can safely buy a used Verizon Pixel 2 without worrying about being locked on Verizon. The phone will be always activatable on Google Fi, even if you don't have an Fi SIM (see above). (3) The always-on standby screen display is improved, and now not only shows a clock, date, and temperature, but also battery status. There is very little battery draw on the standby screen. To me, this is the perfect phone, and for the first time I believe I may not need a replacement for a few years. In the past, annual replacement, or even midyear replacement had to be made due to lack of satisfaction of the phone performance. Now with Pixel XL 2, if it isn't good for five years, at least I'm expecting three years, which is reasonable. I feel mobile phones as a product evolution have got to a point like what PCs became around 2010. Pixel XL 2 is the proof. Before year 2010, desktop computers were always lacking in some serious aspects, making frequent upgrades necessary. But after year 2010, a well-speced PC could provide a minimum of five years of satisfactory service, and if you're not too picky, perhaps 10 years. Product lifecycle is a big issue. Upgrading a PC or a mobile phone is an extremely costly experience, not just because of the direct costs, but more importantly the time cost. For someone who is choosy on the configurations of PC or phone, switching to a new device is extremely time-consuming. In my own experience, every time when I got a new PC, it would cumulatively cost me a minimum of 20 hours to set everything up to meet my particular requirements. This is mostly system, desktop environment and software configuration. A lot of tweaking is necessary on a new PC. Fortunately, Android has made switching to a new phone a lot easier than switching to a new PC. Most of the switch including app installation, data transfer, and system configuration are made automatic. But not everything, especially when you use many apps that require personalized settings and data configuration. So still, it would take several hours to get everything right. I'm hoping to hold onto the Pixel XL 2 for at least a few years.",1.0,Google,Google Pixel 2 XL 128GB Unlocked GSM/CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 12.2MP Camera - Just Black

Unfortunately, I began to have some issues with it after about 3 weeks. First off, I want to say that I like stock Android, but not on this phone. It does not feel like a high quality, well built phone. The audio quality is a 3 out of 10, the finger print sensor works when it wants to (which is hardly ever), and like others have mentioned - it has battery issues. I've had mine die in 4-5.5 hours. Google's customer support is a total joke compared to Microsoft (used to have Windows phone for work). My recommendation: don't buy into the hype or drink the Pixel 2 Koolaid.

Screen brightness is poor but for highest settings. Fingerprint reader is hit or miss at times. Easy of use is very good. Sound quality in earphones is not loud enough to please. Speaker volume is very poor. Transfer of music files was frustrating because of the filing system which does not provide deep access, even with a computer. Charges reasonanly fast. AMOLED screen brilliance is lacking by comparison with Samsung super AMOLED. Making me wish I had bought a Galaxy device. Texting is difficult on the small 5 inch screen. The screen is just not sensitive enough. Picture/photo quality is simply excellent, both in day and night situations and is the best thing this phone has going for it.

I initially couldn't transmit SMS messages to a Verizon customer using Hangouts, the native Android Messenger, or Hangouts from a PC (even though I could receive their messages and still reply with MMS messages + had no problems with voice calls). It was awful because it still appeared on my end to be sent successfully. Fortunately, this problem self resolved after a few days.

B076QKMQ81,metzgerf16,1,"August 29, 2018",True,Falls Short of Flagship Phone Standards,"I've had my Google Pixel 2 XL since May 2018, so I feel that I have given it a fair amount of time for an evaluation. In short, it fails to meet expectations for a phone in this price range and category. Android Auto still crashes randomly and almost always crashes anytime the phone loses one tower for another. That is unacceptable. There is no excuse for a Google phone failing to run a core application from it's own company. This has been a problem with the Pixel 2 phones since they were released, and Google has yet to address it. The only way to restart Android Auto is to unplug the USB cord and plug it back in, which is not something one cares to do while driving in traffic. Another issue with this phone is the sometimes wonky screen interaction. The touchscreen calibration is off just enough to irritate you and cause extra tapping and website navigation. Example: you tap ""Like"" on a Facebook post, and instead of getting ""like"" the browser navigates away from your news feed to the individual post. You tap ""back"", the browser navigates back, you tap ""like"" again, and the browser navigates to the individual post again. I know this sounds petty, but its incredibly annoying when it happens over and over again. The screen is also inconsistent in how it registers touches/taps. If you attempt to tap a link or button near the bottom or edge of the screen, you will get inconsistent responses. This can be avoided by zooming or moving the content to the center of the screen, but you can't always do that with mobile pages. When you attempt to watch embedded videos in full screen mode the video will expand to full screen, and when you rotate the phone to view full screen video the phone will revert back to the embedded view and auto scroll to the top of the current web page. Again, not a huge deal, but it's not a bug you expect to encounter from a top level phone. The fingerprint reader is very inconsistent. Sometimes it just flat will not read my finger at all. It just defaults to ""not recognized"", and then you re-tap until it maxes out the failed attempts and demands a PIN entry. This easy enough to remedy when the only thing you're doing is looking at your phone, but it's a real problem when you're say, driving in LA and Android Auto glitches out. So you pick up your phone to change the USB mode, but now the fingerprint reader refuses to work. You double tap the screen to activate it, and it comes on. Then you swipe up with your thumb to enter your PIN, but the wonky screen does the half swipe for no reason so you have to swipe again. You enter your six digit PIN and open the screen, but then you have to turn your attention to driving and your screen times out. Rinse and repeat. Pros: The construction is high quality, and the fit, finish, and feel is on point. The camera is excellent. Battery life is great. It runs most apps very well. No bloatware. If it weren't for the issues mentioned above, the Pixel 2 XL would be an amazing phone.

B0787V183F,Amazon Customer,5,"May 10, 2018",True,Received a great device in mint condition,"Since my 2 year old Nexus 5x finally hit the dreaded bootloop issue and I needed a phone faster than LG would turn around a warranty replacement, I found myself in the market for a new phone. Being a Project Fi subscriber, this pretty much narrowed down my choices to the Moto 4x or a Pixel 2 phone. I ruled out the 4x because I've had bad experiences when it comes to Android software updates for non-Google Android phones in the past. Unfortunately the Pixel phones are significantly more expensive than the Nexus phones used to be, hence the decision to go refurbished. I ended up ordering a ""Kinda Blue"" Pixel 2 (64GB) from Kanga Supply. The phone shipped quickly and arrived on time via UPS. This was critical for me since I needed the replacement phone to arrive before going on a trip. The vendor had sent the phone requiring signature confirmation, which I appreciate. The phone arrived in a generic white box but was very well packaged, with peel-off protection on the screen. The device I received was in mint condition. The phone proved to be fully functional and arrived running Oreo 8.0. I did notice a faint clicking noise about twice a second in a test call, which is a known issue with the Pixel 2 phones that was fixed by Google in a software update. The problem went away after I let the phone apply all the pending software updates. -- Also the phone that I received seems to have been a Verizon one, and not a Google one, since the ""OEM Unlocking"" option under ""Developer Options"" is greyed out, which would indicate a locked bootloader. -- However the phone is NOT SIM locked and it activated on Project Fi without a hitch. Also for giggles, the box that the phone came in listed the color as ""Verizon Blue"". -- If you care about an unlocked bootloader you might want to avoid the ""Kinda Blue"" variant of the Pixel 2, since this color was a Verizon exclusive for a few months, so I guess there's a higher chance of receiving a phone that was initially sold through Verizon/has a locked bootloader. In terms of accessories, the phone was bundled with a generic USB A charger that was marked ""5V, 2.1A"" and a USB A to USB C cable. I confirmed that I could charge the phone with the supplied charger and cable, but the charger/cable combo would NOT do rapid charging. --- Again not a big deal for me since the phone was ""Charging rapidly"" using the old charger and cable I used to use with my Nexus 5x. Also I did NOT receive any other accessories with the phone, such as the USB C to headphone adapter or any kind of written documentation. But this was mentioned in the listing and I didn't expect anything else. Summarizing, I am happy with the service I received from Kanga Supply and with the device itself. Would recommend the Pixel 2 as well as Kanga. EDIT: What I mistook for small blemishes around the edges of the phone is actually a design feature, as confirmed by closely looking at online images of Pixel 2 phones.

I bought the phone in white. It still looks good, but it's color highlighted much of the wear this phone has accrued in its time; the most obvious being the hairline cracks in the weak points of the phone. I bought a hard case for it anyway so I am not too concerned. The cameras were in perfect condition and the screen showed no signs of scratching, although there's extremely minute burn-in on parts of the screen where you'd expect it to be. You don't notice it unless you're really looking hard for it. Generic packaging was ok, but didn't have any bubble wrap on the phone itself. It came with a charger + usbc cable, the sim card tool was a nice touch, but slightly disappointed that It was missing the usbc-to-headphone jack.

It's totally my fault for not reading more, but honestly I didn't know there were some Pixels with a locked bootloader...but apparently Verizon managed to talk Google into it. Jerks. Anyway I wish I could root, but honestly there's so much you can do without root now that it's not that big of a deal. However, great as this phone is, next time I think I'll look at swappa first.

One thing: it does come with a generic charger and USB-C cable, which I don't trust. I mean the charger is fine...but I've only ever used an Anker cable with it. I can't say for sure, but I suspect maybe some of the reviewers who have had motherboard failures and such might be the victims of bad USB-C cables. I've read articles about how a bad USB-C cable can fry a device. I saw a spreadsheet a while back, put together by an engineer working for Google, reviewing reliable cables. I think he had a very expensive tablet or phone get fried by a generic, and that was his inspiration for doing the reviews.

B0787V183F,Marisela Castro,5,"October 31, 2019",True,"Reliable, Sleek, with Great Battery Life!","I used to have the original Google Pixel 32 GB. I decided to make the switch a little over a year ago from Apple because to be honest, I was done giving Apple my coins especially because with each new phone, older generations of the iPhone kept slowing down and messing up. I also have most of my files and info on Gmail and Google Drive both for work and personal so the switch was much needed! The Google Pixel was great but it was a little slow and the battery life has diminished significantly within a year of use so I decided to switch to Google Pixel 2. I purchased a refurbished Google Pixel 2, white, with 64 GB. I was seriously SHOCKED when I saw the quality of the phone upon opening the box. I had to do a double take and check to make sure they hadn't charged me full price for a brand new Google Pixel 2 because it looks impeccable. My older phone had little bumps around the edges which is expected for any refurbished phone but behold, this phone has absolutely no dents or scratches. The phone is sleek and easy to hold. Since most of my files are on Google Drive, I was able to switch everything over easily. I easily moved the SIM card from my old phone to the new one effortlessly. I have Cricket Wireless and it was able to connect just fine. I didn't lose any files in the process of switching over which is a major plus because I can remember the countless times I lost files with iPhone. Another bonus that was unexpected was that the phone already came with a glass screen protector! That was a great surprise. Overall the phone so far is working amazingly. It's a smooth design so it just sits well in your hand. I was about to get the Google Pixel 2 XL but since I have small hands I wanted to opt out for the regular size and boy was it worth it. I bought this phone from Tech Wholesale and they were amazing with delivery as well. Since I live in a gated apartment they didn't even leave the phone over the gate, they left a notice letting me know that I could pick it up at a local Walgreens which was super easy. If you're looking to update your phone because you're just tired of it slowing down on you or tired of constantly having to charge your phone, I highly recommend purchasing this one from Tech Wholesale. Google Pixel thus far has not let me down and I plan on being a loyal customer (until proven otherwise haha).

B0787V183F,LC,3,"January 14, 2019",True,This is not like your other refurbished experiences.,"Let's be clear if you are buying a refurbished anything your expectations shouldn't be too high. However, if I understand it correctly, refurbished items are usually items that are returned under warranty for whatever reason, fixed, and then resold. Normally, they look like new. If we were to agree on that definition then calling these phones refurbished is probably a little bit of a stretch. I ordered two phones, and they were clearly used phones. They work fine but know that you are going to get an item that it is obviusly second hand. They don't even come in their original packaging with original accessories, another clue of their second hand origin. Other than that, you are getting a Pixel 2 at a bargain, which is a top of the line device and it works.

A couple scratches around both speakers on the bezels, and a bit of scuffing on the top left above the camera, but for that was to be expected from a refurbished product so I don't mind it one bit. You aren't paying this price for a phone in perfect condition. Happier still to report that it works with my existing Google Fi account! I'm still waiting on my replacement SIM card, but the virtual SIM feature is very helpful in the interim.

My first issue was that they shipped and didn't tell me I needed to be home to sign for it which was a headache but.. So far the phone works perfectly. I'm Previous pixel owner so I knew what to look for. The phone did come with the SMALLEST scratch on the top left of the screen but it's incredibly tiny and didn't impact anything. The battery has needed to be charged Midway through my day today but that's because I was downloading all my apps and albums. I'm a heavy user so when when I had a brand new pixel 2 xl I had to charge twice a day. The overall body of the phone was great for the price and it being refurbished. I know I could've talked someone down on offer up or CL but this at least comes with support and Amazon guarantee. I also got what looks like a certified Google USB C charging cable and brick that is fast charging which wasn't expected based on other reviews. I'm not here looking for FULLY unlocked phone so I can put custom ROMs on because it's not that serious,. So if you're looking for a great unlocked Pixel this is it.

The phone did only come with a basic charger which is just fine that's what the listing stating. If you buy a brand new Pixel 2 it doesn't come with headphones just FYI. It would have been nice if this had come with a headphone adapter and the transfer adapter (if you're switching over from iPhone) but it's only $10 at Best Buy or even less on Amazon for each. So for saving $200+, I'll spend $20. The phone itself is awesome and easy to use/navigate. Display looks amazing and so does the camera.

Mine came with the December software update, which allows you to bypass some of the bootloader restrictions - but the phone does, of course, automatically download and install updates, and the January update fixes the vulnerability that was being used to unlock the bootloader. From what research I can find, you're almost certainly getting the Verizon version from most stores, so the bootloader is likely going to be locked which will prevent you from rooting. Note this is a bootloader issue, not a network issue - the phone itself is unlocked to work on any network as advertised, and happily accepted my Sprint SIM (SIMOLW416Q).

My 4 year old workhorse, last of its breed (removable battery), Galaxy S5 did not play well with a custom android ROM update. It decided to kill my cell service. The thought of going back to the bloated, ancient, unpatched, vanila android was not appealing at all. A new Pixel 2 was my first choice, but I couldn't get that shipped next day. I ordered this certified refurbished one instead and I wasn't sure what to expect. When I received it, I inspected it closely. I was trying very hard to find any kind of cosmetic flaw. I could not find a single tiny scuff or mark. Not one! That's a great start. It looks brand spanking new. Next, I turned it on. Fast forward a few days, mostly because my service provider support sucks, but I finally got this phone setup and working the way I want. This phone is blazing fast! The camera has some kind of magical software that makes every photo look amazing. I love the front facing stereo speakers. They sound nice and clear. The fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone is positioned perfectly and it works just as perfectly. Compared to my 4 year old Galaxy S5, there is nothing revolutionary here, but every single aspect is done so much better that the overall package is a pretty big leap forward. I can't really say anything negative about it. The only thing that would make this phone perfect for me is if it had a removable battery. I did find one issue, but from what I understand it's a bug with Wifi in the latest version of Android and not specific to this phone. When the phone first tries to connect to my Wifi router at work, it actually causes the router to reboot. After the router reboots, the wifi connection works fine with the phone after that. I don't think it's only Asus, but apparently this is common with Asus routers RT-AC66U and RT-N66U. Asus tries pointing their finger at the phone being the issue, and it probably is due to the bug in android, BUT my phone doesn't kill my Netgear router at home. So clearly, Asus has some blame. No buggy wifi device, no matter how bugged it is should be able to take down an entire network that easily. So if you have one of the routers above, proceed with caution. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who's looking for a great android device. I'm glad I discovered how great an Amazon certified refurbished phone is because I may never buy new again. The one I received looks brand new and it cost much less then new!",3.0,Google,"Google Pixel 2 64 GB, Black Factory Unlocked (Renewed)"
B0787V183F,Mrs Oliphant fan,5,"September 25, 2019",True,Great phone - with Android 10 self-installing on Day 1,"This review is for the blue ""Renewed"" Pixel 2. Very attractive - no scratches. (Fyi I created a small scratch myself when opening the sim tray, so caution is advised!) I put the old phone's sim card into the tray, and it worked immediately to make phone calls and send SMS (text). But MMS (text plus photo) wouldn't work, so I called the carrier who provided the correct APN settings. The battery seems to last barely 24 hours by setting Battery Saver to turn on at 75% full, so that it will suppress the background apps that typically drain the battery. The camera is wonderful! The Night Sight feature is fantastic for low light situations. And after comparing lots of pix, came to the conclusion Night Sight seems to be always best even when there is plenty of light. Btw I am using the photo setting ""HDR+ Enhanced"" all the time. Sharp, high quality photos. I like bright-colored pictures, so after taking a pic I can select the ""little arrows"" icon underneath, to adjust the pic using Auto Adjust and the many other modes. For additional edits, google's Snapseed app on Playstore is fantastic. It has many tools including: 1. Crop pictures. 2. Rotate any degree. 3. Use Perspective tool to straighten/realign the pic (including correcting perspective when something square looks trapezoidal because of the angle at which the photographer took the pic). 4. Use Healing tool to erase small objects or small imperfections. (Note there is a Windows app which is more sophisticated called Inpaint, so if the requirements were more complex, I would email the photo to myself and edit it on my Windows laptop, then send it back to myself.) I added a nice wallpaper to the home screen, then downloaded Nova Launcher to do additional customization, especially removing the search bar. (Set it to None, and use the google Search icon instead.) For an optional text message app I chose Handcent, aka NextSMS, and upgraded to the Gold $10 per year version to get cloud backups of my SMS and MMS messages, plus the ability to log in to Handcent from other devices including my Windows laptop. This is handy when I want to send someone a photo or document from the laptop. In Windows just click Connect, and It works by silently communicating with the phone, so that it doesn't matter whether you send the text from the phone or a tablet or a laptop - to your recipient it will look the same as usual. The default keyboard is very poor. But Swiftkey in the Playstore provides a terrific keyboard which can be black on white or white on black, by looking under Themes, then Yours. There are a bunch more choices under Gallery, but you have to provide your phone or email to access these. This paragraph is only for those interested in Android 10: happily the phone was already on Android 9, and within a few hours it had updated itself to Android 10. Then I went into Playstore which holds a list of the apps already installed on the phone and selected Update All, to be sure Google Camera would be updated to the latest release 6.3. Once all updates are done, if you want to learn more about the phone's features, it is better to google on ""pixel 3"" instead of pixel 2. This is because the updates have made the phone virtually identical to the pixel 3, with only one exception involving panoramic photo shots. (The pixel 3 has a second front-facing camera dedicated to panoramic shots.)",,Google,"Google Pixel 2 64 GB, Black Factory Unlocked (Renewed)"

But the phone that I received was in excellent condition -- I couldn't find any marks or defects at all. It seems indistinguishable from a brand new Pixel 2, except perhaps for the lack of shrink wrap on the body. Not that it was needed, because the device was still well packaged. The package included what I would have expected: the rapid charger, the USB-C to 3.5 mm headphone dongle (but no actual headphones or earbuds), and a USB-C to USB micro B adapter that allowed me to connect it to my old phone for transferring my apps and data. During setup, I was also able to bring over the Cricket SIM card from my previous phone, and setup worked smoothly.

The Pixel 2 may not be produced anymore ( stopped in April 2019), but it is still the best smaller smartphone out there. Phones are getting too big. It looks new, was completely reset to factory condition. No problem sticking in a SIM and attaching it to my carrier. It ran the update to pie (Android 9) and did the latest security patches. They are working on an Android 10 beta for the Pixel 2 now so when released it will most likely be rolled out to this phone. Great flexibility with an unlocked phone. Has both SIM slot and eSIM for Google Fi. No headphone adapter, but it did come with a descent charger. Fantastic camera. I checked the battery condition with the AccuBattery app, mine has 92% of battery design capacity left - not bad. Charges quick. very happy with the purchase!",,Google,"Google Pixel 2 64 GB, Black Factory Unlocked (Renewed)"
B0787V183F,The Traveling Merchant,1,"August 5, 2019",True,Not the quality you would expect from Google,"I was super excited when I first got this phone, but within 2 weeks it's true colors stared showing. My device would overheat whenever I had a video call. Skype, Whatsapp, Duo, Google Hangouts, IG, it didn't matter what you used for video chats, within 5 mins of a call the phone would overheat and shut off. I was not outdoors in direct sunlight and I had no other applications running, but it overheated on EVERY call I had and all within 5 mins. Furthermore, battery life was terrible. I would have to keep this phone on battery save mode the entire day just so it wouldn't die by lunch. The phone would report ""12% battery life, you have 1 hour left of regular usage"" and it would die 5 minutes later. I can't tell if this is an issue because the phone was ""refurbished"", but I see a lot of people online reporting the same issues with this phone.

So far battery life is very good, keeps me going through a busy day very well, with 1 nightly charge sufficing. 1 thing to note about the refurbished phone, it does not come with the transfer adapter, so it was a bit of a hassle for me, though you can order one online, or I was luck to find one at a Best Buy. Also it doesn't come with the audio cable or other stuff that comes with a newly ordered one.

This is an Amazon certified phone but honestly it looks like it didn't even go through any inspection at all. As if the cosmetic issue wasn't enough, the screen itself starting flickering after being on for just TWO days.

But, of course, as the updates rolled out, it got worse, and worse, and continues to do so. Here are the major downfalls that I wish I had known. -Major touchscreen sensitivity issues. Very frequently won't respond to taps, swipes, or yelling. -The keyboard sits WAY too low on the phone, making it pretty awkward to hold. -Battery issues. I've watched the battery literally drop 10% in less than 5 minutes, doing nothing. -Fingerprint reader. Worked like a dream for the first few months, but doesn't work at all now, even with multiple resets. -Camera. The camera is a joke. If you know anything about photography, or have an eye for a good photo, this phone WILL NOT DELIVER. Colors are always way off, even when changing the lighting settings. You pay $800 for a phone, it better be as good as a DSLR for that price. But, it's not. I had an AT&T Tilt from 2008 that took superior photos. In fact, aost every phone from the last 10 years has taken better photos. -No headphone jack. Idk why Apple started this stupid trend, but it makes no sense. The dongle that comes with it for the 3.5mm headphone plug, broke within a few months, even though it never moved from its home in my home theater cabinet. -Speaker crackling. This is a known issue that they refuse to fix. -It's Google. I was hoping that having the phone not be a major phone manufacturer, it would've been great. Well, then you have all of Google's stupid software on here, like Google photos. Oh, you want to locate a photo in your phone that you took 6 months ago? You can't. Because it's not on your phone. You have go through Google photos, and download it to your phone. What is the point of expandable memory, when everyone streams music, and your photos are apparently not stored on your device? Trying to mess around with uploading photos to Insta? Good luck. Unless you're really tech savvy, you probably won't figure it out. -Screen brightness can be awful. I don't understand why when I'm watching media indoors on my phone with the brightness all the way up, I still can't see, especially during a night scene. The list goes on, and on. Do yourself a favor, and look into the lesser-known-in-America brands, like Huawei. You get way more phone, for less money. Some of them aren't android based, which is a major win (I loathe Apple even more). The positives are. -Expandable memory. Most Android based phones have this, however. -Big screen.

The seller took great care in shipping the phone with no issues regarding cracked or damaged ittems. The phone is the Pixel 2 which is cheaper than the latest model. I've heard some great reviews about the Google phone but I'm not too impressed. ISSUES: 1. The phone stops video streaming when attached or detached from charger. You'll have too go completely out of the streaming video and back into it again. Not convenient. 2. When watching Youtube videos, you'll have to manually 'x' out of the control feature every single time, for every single video. The controls won't simply disappear like Xfinity go or Amazon videos. 3. ""Ok Google"" option is less reliable on the Google phone than Samsung. How's that possible that the Google features and entertainment platforms work horribly on a Google phone than any other Android products? Final: I've given up on Samsung becaise of the subpar and rather suspicious customer service experience in 2018. I won't invest in a Apple phone due to it's closed market. The Andriod Market is the best in comparison. When it comes to the Google phone, the only bright side is thw battery life and picture ond picture taking qualities. That's not enough to keep me from moving on to other Andriod based phones outside of the aforementioned and perhaps taking a chance on an LG phone in the future.

The back didn't have a scratch or smudge on it and the screen initially looked flawless. Upon closer inspection there were 2 or 3 TINY surface scratches on the screen that were barely noticeable with the screen off and definitely not noticeable with the screen on. The speaker grills (both) were fairly dirty, as if a construction worker had this phone for a day or two in a really dusty environment, but it didn't affect the phone's operation at all and I was actually able to clean it up a little bit myself. The phone itself as far as everything else and operation is PERFECT. Battery lasts all day and then some with average use. There have been a few times already where I was lighter on my phone usage that day and I around 7 or 8pm I look at my phone and it's still at 60 or 70% (and that's getting up and taking it off the charger at 5AM). There are ZERO functional issues with this phone and I would buy it again in a heartbeat... Thankfully I don't think I will need to as I'm sure this thing will last quite a few years! The ONLY issue is not a refurb or seller issue, but a Pixel 2XL issue and I thought I'd shed some light on it. My bottom speaker sounded muffled/metallic and blown out with the volume over 50%, especially after 75%. I contacted MobiSpree and they were more than willing to refund me (great service!), but I did some quick research and found out apparently it's the result of a loose speaker grill and was very common among Pixel 2XL devices. Following instruction on another website, I took a store rewards card (hard but pliable plastic) and used the corner of it to press gently down on the grill from the middle to each edge (be sure not to press TOO hard, as I've read you can heard a POP and it is actually the waterproofing seal that breaks, so don't do that). I did this 2 or 3 times and it completely fixed my issue. I can now have my phone at 100% volume and it sounds tons better than my last phone at max volume.

I immediately purchased a replacement cable and charging block to sort out that issue. Still no quick charge though, which is a bit of a bummer, but I guess I will figure my way around that. Coming from my Mate 10 Pro which has outstanding battery life and fast charge My major concern was the condition of the device, battery life and the fear that the Screen is as bad as reviews I have read and watched. I must say upon initial inspection, I did notice minor chips and scratches, a bit of a damper on my purchase because some reviews claim receiving spotless units. Due to the price I paid, I accepted it, and understand that it is a refurbished unit and overlooked the scratches and chips. At this price you cannot expect a brand new device. With that said, its the only thing that has really been an issue for me. Furthermore, the Pixel 2 XL is everything that I expected it to be. The screen is not as punchy and bright as the Mate 10 or my previous Note 8, it is not bad either. The battery is outstanding, the charging times are just ""NORMAL"" but the snappy software,regular software updates, amazing camera, stereo speaker sound quality, software features and everything that comes with the PIXEL makes me feel great about my purchase.

B0799ZMY6D,DeanD,1,"October 16, 2019",True,Be wary! These “renewed” phones may come with third party software that monitors your phone!,"Be very wary of buying an Amazon renewed phone! My phone came with a third party admin app installed, Pythia. The lock screen says “This device is managed by your organization”! That’s right, a “renewed” phone that lets someone monitor your phone and even delete all your data! Ridiculous! Google had no tech help in getting rid of it and Amazon was of no assistance except to offer a refund. I’m on a work trip with a possibly comprised phone. When I get home I can either do a full re-image and lose all the time I spent setting up a phone and then spend all that time setting it back up. Or I can do a full re-image and send it back to Amazon for a refund/exchange that could again result in a comprised phone. Lovely! Never mind, can't re-image because it came with a locked boot loader. Other than the above, the actual phone is very nice. No factory charger so it charges really, really slow. Update 10/21/19 Phone is a Verizon model and I'm using it on Google Fi. A notification came up saying that Verizon wanted to use my location! Just ridiculous! Reminds me why I got rid of Verizon years ago. My advice: buy this phone and see if it is as old Verizon one. Then exchange it till you get an unlocked on.

B0799ZMY6D,matt law,5,"February 1, 2019",True,Really looked new,"I've bought several refurbished phones in the past including a pixel xl for my wife. This phone was by far the best condition of all the phones I have received. There was no damage at all and the device was very clean. Looked brand new, and I don't say that lightly. The ports have all been throughly cleaned and the battery appears to be new, according to several apps I used to test it. Based off some reviews it appears I was rather fortunate, that said I received a very high quality phone, so they do exist. I am not reviewing the phone as much as I am reviewing its refurbishment. I am sure that you know what makes a pixel good and it's why you are considering a refurb. Pros: -Very Clean -New(ish) battery (can't confirm definitively) but the apps are marking it as 100% -No scratches or visible wear and tear. Cons: - As stated everything the phone comes with is generic, and the charger I received is not a fast charger. - It does not come with a headphone usb-c converter that a stock new one comes with, but that is also listed in the summary, it would just be nice if it did. Summary Like I said I have purchased a lot of refurb in the past and this is the best I've ever received. That is not everyone's experience and I can only speak for myself. I rolled the dice and got the jack pot.

B0799ZMY6D,Deserea,5,"May 31, 2019",True,So happy!,"I'm going to break this down into the phone review and the seller review: Seller: The phone shipped out in a decent amount of time. Just be aware that they print the label for the shipping a day or two in advance of actually shipping the phone. So if you're like me, you'll get excited thinking your phone has shipped when it really hasn't. The charger they include in the box is a standard Samsung Adaptive Fast Charger with a 3m USB-c to USB-a cord. It charges VERY slowly. I think this is due to the high capacity of the battery and the wattage of the charger. Anyway, I would strongly suggest that you factor in the cost of a Google brand phone charger. Best buy sells them for 39.99. (Amazon's listed one's are not actually Google branded and per the reviews it does matter). The shipping does require a signature (woot woot)' so plan for that. The ""white"" version which I ordered is actually the ""Panda"". It's mostly white on the back with a 1/4 of the panel at the top being black. The phone: This thing is amazing! I mean everyone talks about the camera and they are not kidding! I actually had to do a double take on a selfie I took because it got such good detail (I didn't even realize my pores we're that big 😂). The battery life is stellar. I've been putting this thing through the ringer with pretty much non-stop use for the 7 hours I've been awake (since 3:30 AM for reference in picture) and it still is saying I'll have battery until 6:15pm. The OS is fast, easy to customize, and user friendly. Only beef I have is the Navigation buttons cannot be swapped. I'm right-handed so having the back button all the way on the left side of this lovely huge screen is a bit of an inconvenience. After looking it up, the fix for swapping them sounds like it's going to goof up a lot of other things. So I'll deal. The screen though... The design of how the edges flow and bezels start and stop is so pretty. The screen itself is very vivid. Sounds comes from both bottom and top speaker so you get closer to the immesi e sound you're used to from other tech. If you can, use Google one to back up your old phone first; it makes the swap so much easier. Only grip besides the nav buttons is that there are two physical buttons on the right side of the phone and none on the left. Both the power/lock button and volume buttons are pretty close so I get them confused. I'll adjust.

That was a MISTAKE and let me tell you why. My refurbished phone was working fine since I got it around last February till two weeks ago. Pixel 2 XL is supposed to be IP rated and can be used under water and before two weeks ago I never tried that till one day I decided to give it a shot and took some pictures in the pool, I was very careful not to get more than a feet under water. After getting out of the pool things started to get crazy with my phone. Whenever I plug it to the charger or my car sound system (using the USB converter) the phone shuts down!! I contacted the seller and their reply was basically that warranty period has passed and we cannot help you! Please contact Google! I contacted Google and they were more helpful but at the end they said the phone was not sold via Google and they cannot cover warranty. I contacted the seller again with Google's reply. This time they actually NEVER replied back!!! Today, somehow, my phone is not shutting down when connected to the charger but still won't connect to audio converter. If the refurbished phone shouldn't be used under water, they should've mentioned that on their ad!! Unacceptable dishonesty and VERY unprofessional seller. I would just spend the extra $200 to get a fully functioning device instead or at least if I had a heads up, hey don't use it under water, this feature is not working, I would rate it more than just one star.",17.0,Google,"Google Pixel 2 XL 128 GB, Black (Renewed)"

The only cosmetic positive was the screen was perfect. After noting the poor quality of this ""Renewed"" = USED phone, I needed to do a water test. One of the best things about this phone is that it is IP67 = 1 meter (3 feet) for 30 minutes rated. I put it under water (6"") and it was fine then within a minute the screen went black. FAILED! The charger is incorrect. Generic is fine but not to spec is not OK. These phones are design to be fast charging and require a 2A charger. Supplied was 0.3A. A pathetic joke. Don't even bother.

The WiFi is A LOT better than the Pixel XL's, which has a huge known bug in the 2.4 GHz bands. So nice to have a phone again that does not have that bug. Also, this phone will support Android Q and maybe its successor, so it's a bit future proof. The display is also quite good. The only thing missing is a headphone jack, but I am being assimilated. Once wireless charging is everywhere, there will probably be no holes in phones at all and they will be waterproof, so that's just one step closer to that future I guess.

It's got a good sleek feel, is not loaded with bloatware, and of course, gets all the latest updates pronto. In the middle ground, the camera is highly touted and is good, but I can't say it's better than what I had with the Galaxy 8+. Here's what I miss, however: No removable SD card. No wireless charging. And worst of all, no DEX (ability to use your phone as a computer with keyboard, mouse and monitor.) I have to admit, I loved my Galaxy using DEX. I have tried to get similar mirroring with the Pixel using Sentio Desktop, Displaylink and a Displaylink adapter. You have to write in a bunch of code lines to get it functional at all, and in the end, I have just given up on it (at least for now.) The display was not accurate and there were other notable limitations. Let's just say, it wasn't even close to DEX.

Once I realized the mistake it had shipped so I figured I'd give it a try, and I'm glad I did. It still fits in most shirt pockets and really isn't more of a problem than my previous Samsung S5 (yeah, I was overdue for an upgrade.) The Pixel XL has a great camera. I have very shaky hands (essential tremor) and had a very difficult time taking photos with the Samsung. The Pixel has auto stabilization and it makes a world of difference. It also takes great pictures in low light (and I believe there are hacks to make it work even better, or upcoming upgrades.) The speaker and mic are a big improvement over the Samsung. With the Samsung, on calls using speaker mode, it would block out the mic whenever someone at the other end was speaking. Not a problem with the Pixel. The speaker still isn't quite as good as my wife's iPhone (5S, I think; maybe 6S.) Phone reception is now at least as good as my wife's iPhone, where the Samsung was definitely inferior. The battery seems to last forever on standby -- if I haven't used it much for a day it only drops about 20%. I'm not a power user so I can't speak to how well it lasts under loads, but I never run out of battery at the end of the day, and don't have to keep an eye on it all the time. It was indistinguishable from a brand new phone, except for the packaging. It came with unbranded white charger and short cable (with USB-C connector on each end.) The pixel says ""charging rapidly"" so whether it's original or not, it's at least rapid-charging-capable. My ammeter app says it's charging at 1000 milliamps. I expected more amperage, but the ammeter only shows when the phone is unlocked and perhaps it charges faster when locked.

I believe that this product is not a Google product because I bought another pixel 2 xl and it doest over heat and all the issues mentioned above is not present on the new phone I bought from Google directly.

Most of the time I'm on wi-fi at work and at home so I didn't notice the issues right away, but eventually after several hours on the phone with my carrier and comparing performance side-by-side with my wife's non-refurbished Pixel 2, I realized that there was just something fundamentally wrong with the phone. Basically I suspect the phone was returned for this reason, was never actually resolved, and then resold to a sucker like me.

It seems like the bad data connection was the reason this phone was returned. I am usually in an environment where I have access to wifi so it hasn't bothered me too much yet, and that is why it took me a long time to realize the problem, but It is definitely a significant one. The camera is very good quality but there's something wrong with the display of the phone. Compared to my last phone (Moto G5 Plus) the display quality seems low, not in resolution (of course) but in colors. The phone seems to have a light but permanent orange tint in its display, no matter what I do with the display settings. I have compared the display with all of my other laptops, monitors, tv, and older phones with same pictures. So, buyers be careful. You might end up with a good phone or really crappy ones. From the ratings, it seems like a lot of the people either got good phones or choose to ignore the problems because it didn't bother them too much. For me, I travel from time to time and need a good data connection, so its a bummer, also as an artist with intermediate skills the display is starting to bother me so much that I decided to write a review.

B079C1K282,Tyler Brooks,3,"January 1, 2019",True,Great value for a quality phone,"I have been shopping for a budget android phone for a few months and couldn't get happy with any of the options. (nokia 6.1/7.1 are probably the best) So I saw a pixel 2 xl refurb for $390 it really caught my attention. The conclusion i am debating is is it worth 3 or 4 stars The pros: For under 400 dollars i have a pixel 2 xl that is very quick, no lag at all and i will almost certainly use it for the next year or 2 (or 3 if it continues to get updates from google) the phone works exactly like you would expect a pixel 2 xl too. In addition, I just figured out that i actually got a google model and not a verizon one The cons: there are 3-4 pretty good knicks around the rim of the phone Also the sim tray has some paint chipped off. Also there are quite a few minor scratches around the screen, they are nearly imperceptible without a flashlight shining directly on it though. Lastly, there are ""minimal to no signs of wear on the back of the phone"" like in the phones description. It is too bad the entirety of the phone can't claim that. My biggest issue though is the battery, after running accubattery for a few days it calculates i have 80-90 % battery health. It is really disappointing that they don't put in a new battery when they ""refurbish"" these things. Also as many reviews have said the grills weren't cleaned. So yea those 2 things each get a star knocked off: Battery and small chips I have read a majority of the reviews on this page This listing might be more accurate to say you are buying a used phone and not a refurbished phone. As such, if you happen to get a gently used phone it is great and if you get a used phone in bad condition that would lead to the high number of negative reviews Overall though, I would say i am pleased, If you have used a sub par phone for any length of time, like a couple months as i had, getting back to a phone like this that is snappy, updated and full of features is a godsend and for under $400.

The only draw back to this refurbished phone is that it is a refurbished Verizon Pixel 2 XL, which for some may not be a big deal but for me it has left me disappointed. The reason being is that it can not be boot-loader unlocked and rooted, so if your intentions are like mine you may want to pass this phone up and get it from the google store as that is the only place you will find the truly unlocked version of this phone.

B079C1K282,Steven,5,"July 3, 2019",True,Love this phone so far.,"After having a number of Motorola phones fail me, all with the same issue, and my research indicating their other phones suffered from the same issue, I was in a bit of a quandary. My carrier's other phones didn't meet my expectations, and their sim application limited my choices (and my budget) for an 'outside' phone. This was one of the small list that met my criteria, but buying brand new was more than I cared to spend. Then I found this reconditioned option at Amazon. I was a little hesitant initially, but after reviewing their warranty I thought I'd give it a try. So far, the phone has exceeded all expectations. The screen quality is more than adequate, the audio quality of the phone is superior to any other phone I've ever owned, and the camera is simply outstanding. I consider this a real bargain and the smartest purchase I've made so far this year. Highly recommended.",,Google,"Google Pixel 2 XL 64 GB, Black (Renewed)"

Now, if I put this phone in anyone's hand, you would've sworn that I got the device straight from Google in 2017. My supplier was Tech Wholesale and they were great. The speed of the phone, camera and all around usability is just awesome. It's not a buy that you'd regret in 2019 if you're looking for a nice budget phone at a cost that suits the pocket as the snappy performance and great cam will not let you down. i.e. To me, the screen is a tad lackluster as it could've been better (in terms of quality).

I have been using this phone for about two months now. I love it. If you are unsure about a Pixel phone like I was this is a great starting point. I am sticking with Pixel's for now on. The only reason the review received 4 instead of 5 is because the phone is NOT sent with the original accessories such as the USB-C to female audio converter, charging cord and Google USB-C ear phones. Instead it is sent with a cheap USB-C 6 inch charging cord and a USB-C wall socket converter because the cord is USB-C on both ends.

B079C1K282,JER,1,"August 8, 2019",False,BEWARE!!! ... unless you love being FURIOUS!,"I have never had so much trouble with a phone in my life!!! The DAILY, INCESSANT annoyance is that this phone is CONSTANTLY making unwanted calls, just because it touches something -- in your pocket, in your purse, on a countertop -- EVERYWHERE! It also turns on random videos, music, and sends TEXTS! But the most INFURIATING started when my camera app stopped working. After about 30 hours (over 6 months) of texts, calls, emails and probably other back and forth contacts with Verizon, I finally got a new (USED) phone. To be SURE everything was done properly, I went into the Verizon store to have everything transferred to the new/old one. Today I discovered a LOT of missing text messages -- CRITICAL messages regarding insurance claims and work related issues. Why? Because the Google Pixel only backs up to GOOGLE DRIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And Google LIES about their process!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They don't tell you until it's TOO LATE that they RANDOMLY DELETE YOUR TEXT MESSAGES and DON'T BACK UP ANYTHING that has pictures or videos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Google is GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2.0,Google,"Google Pixel 2 XL 64 GB, Black (Renewed)"
B079C1K282,Fremen,2,"August 31, 2018",False,Expensive piece of disappointment,"Let me preface this by saying I have had my share of smart phones. Starting with the very first Android phone the Tmobile G1, and countless others since then including the Samsung cheapo phones they sell at walmart and the Samsung top of their line phones like the S5 etc. and then the LG G4, G5 and LG V10. and even had an Iphone 7 plus for a while...then I settled on this Pixel 2 XL. First of all, the camera is pretty good. It takes great pics. However LG G5 etc was smarter in including a wide angle lens for selfies and even one for regular shots. I was always able to get amazing shots of the entire group, while the pixel2 has no wide angle capabilities and I'm usually having to step far away to get everyone in the shot. But that's the good thing about this phone. The bad thing. First of all, the speakerphone volume is a joke. I don't know what is the problem with this phone, but there is no consistency to it. Either the person on the other hand is barely audible or they're too loud. This is ridiculous. It shouldn't matter what the source signal volume is, you should be able to boost that to the max that the speakers on this phone can handle. I know it can be much louder because sounds like the chime when you hit voice to text in fb messenger is insanely loud to the point of hurting my ears! So its not a hardware limitation its a software issue. another issue with this phone is probably due more to Android than the phone itself. The sharing mechanisms for photos is a joke. Its horrible. Let me download a photo off the web or from fb. Then if I want to share it or send it to someone..good luck! Every app seems to have its own idea of where to grab photos from. Sometimes the downloads folder is not showing what I just downloaded..why is that? where are they? where did they go? I've resorted to taking screenshots of everything because that's the only way to share the image...even though its there on my storage taking up space....the ridiculous sharing doesn't show whats really there. Is this a performance issue? maybe they're caching things? Iphone was kind of annoying as well because when you modified an image and wanted to share it, it wouldn't let you find the image by modified date, but instead only by the date the picture was taken. so you have to scroll all the way down to where the picture was taken even though you JUST modified it. Well, android is even worse...it doesn't even show the image at all...maybe 2 hours later..it might pop up. This makes me think that Google photos is the problem. The old gallery app would just show the photos on your phone..but I think google photos is doing some syncing and it doesn't work right away. Maybe nothing notifies it that you download a new picture... but whatever the reason its just really poor programming on google's part. Here's another issue..and this is the worst one yet. Since updating to Android pie (9) the OS can be extremely laggy. There are times when it freezes up on me...I can't stand this lag. It feels like I'm using a phone from 10 years ago. there's no excuse to be so laggy...even if I'm on wifi with fast internet, its still laggy. I found others complaining about the same problem on twitter...but no fixes for it ? Oh, one last thing about the sharing feature on android phones. For some reason when you want to share something, it keeps popping up with contacts from various applications...people I've never shared with before. how stupid is that? very stupid. You can easily accidentally share a private photo with random contacts from twitter. That's really stupid....maybe google thinks your private photos should be shared with everyone? i can't find a way to change this or edit what contacts it shows. Everyone says Android is better than Iphone because you can customize it. What are they talking about?? I can't even customize the people it wants to share things with. I would love to stop it from offering to share with random contacts period..but that's not possible either. It may be possible if I root the phone..but that is stupid if that's what you have to do.",4.0,Google,"Google Pixel 2 XL 64 GB, Black (Renewed)"

They delivered fast and I got all the original accessories with the device. There was one small cosmetic chip near the charging port. It was very small and not noticeable. Otherwise I'd have no idea this was a refurbished product. Overall I am very satisfied with this phone. Pros: - software is fluid, fast, and always up to date - the camera is absolutely stunning. I wouldn't consider myself a big photographer but the camera and images are so good and so easy to take I'm constantly taking pictures now. Unlimited photo back up through Google is amazing as well. - the bigger screen (also see cons). I came from an S7 and was nervous this phone would be unweildy. And while it's big enough that it's not always perfect to use with one hand I can do most things with one hand. But I don't mind having to use the other hand for the increased screen real estate. - battery life is good and is lasting me through the day - absolutely no bloatware! - gestures on Android 9 are fluid and snappy - data transfer from my old phone was done in less than 10 minutes. - front facing speakers, not the best quality but the directionality is nice. Cons: - slightly too big to get to every inch of the screen with one hand (I have small hands) - lots of notifications from Google photos - screen brightness leaves just a bit to be desired, always usable but could be brighter in direct light - moving the volume rocker to the left side of the phone would be better.

B079C1K282,JD,1,"March 21, 2018",False,Speakers are garbage on 2XL,"I've had the Pixel 2 XL for two months. I upgraded from a Nexus 6P on the Verizon network. Screen is not as vibrant as 6P (I don't blast my colors, I prefer a more neutral, natural look). Speakers are garbage on 2XL. Can barely hear the phone ringer & text alerts, for trailers I have to use headphones with that stupid dongle. Plus I'll get popping noise in the ear piece. 6P had a beautiful stereo sound & was more than loud enough to watch a trailer on YouTube. 2XL has TONS, TONS! Of false touches because of the edges. Scolling a web page with one hand, 50/50 chance that it thinks I'm holding the edge while scolling down & it starts selecting words or zooming in or something stupid that I don't intend to do. I hang-up on every 5th call because my cheek hits the call-end icon. WTH!!! Really. That's an issue that was addressed & solved with cell phones about 7 or 8 years ago. My phone single (talking on the phone) is horrible. I get pixelization while talking. You can't make this stuff up! This is 2018 & I dealing with problems from 2010. I update my phone monthly. I've used nothing but Nexus & Motorola phones from the beginning of smart phone history. The Pixel is a Pile. BATTERY: one day normal usage (this is tough to explain). My 6P at the end would get me 8 hrs per charge. This thing will give my 12 hrs one day, 24 hrs the next. So it's a guessing game (I don't have Facebook, actually no social media) the 2 XL gets hot some times. That's a guarantee 12-hour day. It's never the same app twice that makes it hot, can't figure it out. I travel a few times a year. My Nexus would take over my phone with Airline information when in an airport, the pixel, good luck! I can't even get it to list the itinerary half the time. Stuck searching Google cards history or trying to find the original email to figure out my itinerary. Speaking of Google cards, they changed how they work. The new style blows! Can't swipe away cards I don't care about. Have to push a 3-dot icon at the corne--- s#!+ There's that false double-touch coming into play. The part that REALLY upsets me is I paid $499 for my Nexus 6P. This piece of garbage cost me $659. I'm glad I didn't pay for any protection plan. Something tells me this thing isn't gonna make it to 1 year for me. Middle finger to Google! Middle finger to P!xEL 2 XL. One final note. I choose Google phones because of the monthly updates & latest operating system. That's why I don't consider Galaxy S9. That leaves apple. The only phone that keeps an updated operating system.

B079C1K282,Robert E. Daniels Jr.,5,"August 13, 2019",True,Pure Perfect!!!,"My old phone was on life support, I needed something cheap and fast to arrive. This arrived next day, about that...the delivery person DELIVERED TO THE WRONG APARTMENT. The address wasn't even close. Luckily, I was able to identify the apartment from the photo he took and I was able to retrieve it from the doorstep, luckily no one was home....I knocked several times to inform them, that this was my package. Anyway, I LOVE THIS PHONE!!! First, if it's a renewed phone, I can't tell, the phone came in pristine condition like new, not a scratch or blemish on it. Phone came with USB-C charger, USB to USB-C adapter which made transferring my data a snap. I just plugged the cable into my old phone following the directions on the Pixel, it did the rest in less than 15 minutes. All of my apps from the Play Store installed as soon as I logged in with my gmail account. One slight snafu, I actually had two gmail addresses added to my old phone, so I had to add both accounts to retrieve all of my contacts and photos. Phone also came with USB-C to 3.5 headphone jack adapter, very nice as some reviews reported not getting hardly anything. The only thing that I did not receive was the little SIM too to insert my SIM card... a paper clip did the trick. One thing to note if you're like me, I had the same phone for close to seven years, so I had the larger SIM, if you have the larger SIM, you'll need to go to your carrier and request a new one, mine cost me $8 for the smaller one. I was told by the rep that you can cut them, found this....you're welcome: https://www.amazon.com/Aerb-Nano-Micro-Nano-Standard-Micro-Standard-Cellphones/dp/B009P16FKY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=SIM+Card+cutter&qid=1565720397&s=gateway&sr=8-3 The Pixel 2XL is outstanding and it's packed with so many cool features that I'll leave you to do your own homework but everything they say about this phone is true. Camera is awesome, the notification screen, the song identification, Google Assistance is BADASS, the squeeze to bring up GA is way awesome. You'll see people peeking at it when you use it...lol. Oh and it's FAST, for me this was a huge step up coming from an Old Samsung Note 3, which I gave a proper burial in my junk drawer, it served me well, so I may be slightly skewed. I can say however, the software truly shines and I have so much control over how things look and behave. The fingerprint reader is flawless. I added both index fingers and the reader not only unlocks the phone but integrates with other secure apps like my banking app and portal to my apartment. The phone is frequently updated, about three a week...which is awesome. Battery life is very good, I can go all day on a charge, that does not include screen on constant play time but reasonable use. I no longer have to lug around a portable battery The one pet peeve I have is, this sucker is thin!! So thin, it's difficulty to pick up from a table. It's a solid phone with a little weight to it, so I'm thinking, how long before I drop this puppy? I got a case immediately, I ordered this one because I didn't want to cover up the phone but add some protection without bulking it up too much. This was perfect flexible and doesn't add bulk or weight, just enough to hang on a little better. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0747813GV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Screen is beautiful. Probably my favorite feature is the call screen which allows you to screen calls. When someone or something calls you, you can hit ""Screen Call"" and your phone will basically say, ""What do you want, they don't want to talk to you, say who you are, what you want and they may decide to talk to you"" when they talk you will see their message transcribed with a choice to accept or deny...BRILLIANT!!!

B079C1K282,The Dad,5,"September 8, 2019",True,Still An Amazing Phone,"I'm usually 1-2 generations behind the latest models but I like to get the best model I can afford from the previous 2 years and this is where I landed. I replaced my Nexus 6p with this phone due to the battery starting to give out and I am super pleased with my decision. I've experienced great battery life (which I was worried about being a ""renewed"" phone). It's fast, plenty of storage space for my needs. Being on a google product for android is the way to go for updates. One thing I think automatically got added was the digital wellbeing app by Google and I've used it to set time limits on social media and I've loved having a reminder to get off the phone. One con I feel like I've noticed is that the phone isn't as good at automatically knowing which bluetooth device to send the audio to. For example, if I'm listening to music or a book on my headset then get in my card the audio stops playing on the headset and technically switches to the car but the car doesn't automatically swith. My old phone would stay on the headset in this situation which I kind of liked.

B079C1K282,andy,5,"January 9, 2019",True,great used/refurb phone.,"you get pretty much what they say you get. A clean, used, refurbed phone. Came in a good size box, in a nice heavy and stiff padded air envelope. Also came with a dual port charger , but not a fast charger- and a usb to usb -c cable. I've been using my old Huawei fast charger. Works pretty well. That's it for accessories. No other adapters. The phone arrived in nice shape. minor scuffing around the bottom edge, likely from having a case where the dust/dirt rubs the finish just a little. No big deal. The back glass was pretty much perfect Front glass had one or two very faint small scratches you can only see with the screen off. otherwise great. 9/10. Buttons all work well and are snappy. Charge port is clean and works well. I gave the battery life 4 stars just because I don't know how it would be like new, probably a little better, but not sure how much. That said i get it close to full before bed. It uses about 8% over night. if it's over 80% when i leave and i use it for maybe a couple hours through out the day i come home with it at least above 50, maybe 60 even. So I guess it's pretty good. software is up to date with android pie. great camera. I came from a Huawei nexus 6p so i'm pretty familiar with plain android, so this phone was quite comfortable to switch to. overall a good phone for the first week i've had it. I hope it keeps up. Just under $400 for a year old flagship phone is a pretty fair price, especially since used ones in similar condition on swappa are going for about the same, though they generally come with the factory goodies.

Cons: Battery life lasts 24hrs+ with moderate usage and constant sync up of all my services unlike my old LG Stylo 4 that lasted nearly 2 days on a single charge. Built quality is great looking but too slick to hold with out worry of slipping out of your hands. I'd recommend a case for sure.

B079C1K282,Alexwin20,2,"November 20, 2018",False,Google Didn't Stand by Their Product,"I bought a Pixel 2 XL back in April on a payment plan direct from the Google store. I had the phone for about 3 months in a case I bought from Google When I noticed that it was scratched up pretty badly from everyday wear. Yes, I should have had a screen protector on it but it was too late at this point. So I let that go because it was my fault. Then a month or so after this my niece dropped it while we were walking home from the school bus stop. It wasn't even a bad drop; not only was the screen cracked but the motherboard was also damaged. Because of this I couldn't even enter my pin to unlock the phone. Suffice it to say it was rendered useless. I contacted the Google store and they said that the electrical issue was covered but because the screen was broken I would have to get that repaired before sending it back to Google. That would cost me $220 on top of the monthly payment that I'm still paying by the way. Luckily I have insurance on my phone through AT&T. So I filed a claim with them instead. I got a new Samsung Galaxy S 8 for $75. I've had a lot of phones and I've dropped them on many surfaces including concrete and in none of those cases was the motherboard damaged. Nor were these phones rendered useless from the drops. Anyway the point is that I will never buy another Google product ever again. The pixel 2 XL was so cheaply made that it became scratched almost instantly and it is unable to sustain any kind of damage minor or otherwise without breaking severely. I would not recommend purchasing a google phone or any of their other products after this experience. I expected more from Google but they couldn't even stand by theire product. Do Not Buy a Google Phone!",2.0,Google,"Google Pixel 2 XL 64 GB, Black (Renewed)"
B079C1K282,Gao Atamazon,5,"November 19, 2018",False,Finally a perfect phone,"A disclaimer: I did not buy the phone here. I bought it used on eBay. So this review is only for the product itself, and had nothing to do with the seller. I had the original Pixel XL and waited for Pixel XL 3. When it finally came out, I was disappointed. No battery life improvement (in fact, it dropped down from Pixel XL 2 according to reviews), and there is that obnoxious notch, even a double notch sometimes. Big turnoffs. So I went ahead to get a used Pixel XL 2 instead. I'm very satisfied. The original Pixel XL was already a great phone. But Pixel XL 2 is about perfect. To me, besides the Pixel line, there is no other option anyway. Reason 1: With Gogle Fi which provides the first and only global network service, the Pixel is really the only global phone. Just travel to another country with an Android phone on Google Fi, and you will understand what I mean by this. Reason 2: I don't want an Apple. And I don't want any third-party renditions of Android either, including Samsung and Huawei, because although they make great hardware, they always manage to damage the true Android experience, both in the user interface and the speed and availability of updates. The only problems I had with the original Pixel XL was that (1) I was running out of storage on the 32 GB; (2) I was desiring a little bit better battery life so it would be able to run through a busy day reliably and comfortably. Better battery life is always desirable. The original Pixel XL had difficulties to last a whole day of heavy use. Even though it is fine 95% of time, just an occasional occurrence of out-of-battery at the end of day is painful enough. As one would be habitually recharging the phone at end of day anyway, at least a whole-day battery life is critically important. Pixel XL 2 solved both problems. In addition, it also has a few nice features that the original Pixel did not have: (1) it has eSIM and can be activated without a physical SIM if you're using Google's Fi network. You can actually insert a physical SIM of an alternative network, but I found that switching back and forth is almost impractical, although possible. Every time when you switch to the physical SIM network, returning back to eSIM would require you to reactivate with Google. Sure reactivation was quite simple, involving just a few clicks, but still it is far from being seamless, and you shouldn't mistake this as a dual-SIM phone. (2) Carriers like Verizon have stopped locking Pixel 2 phones. So you can safely buy a used Verizon Pixel 2 without worrying about being locked on Verizon. The phone will be always activatable on Google Fi, even if you don't have an Fi SIM (see above). (3) The always-on standby screen display is improved, and now not only shows a clock, date, and temperature, but also battery status. There is very little battery draw on the standby screen. To me, this is the perfect phone, and for the first time I believe I may not need a replacement for a few years. In the past, annual replacement, or even midyear replacement had to be made due to lack of satisfaction of the phone performance. Now with Pixel XL 2, if it isn't good for five years, at least I'm expecting three years, which is reasonable. I feel mobile phones as a product evolution have got to a point like what PCs became around 2010. Pixel XL 2 is the proof. Before year 2010, desktop computers were always lacking in some serious aspects, making frequent upgrades necessary. But after year 2010, a well-speced PC could provide a minimum of five years of satisfactory service, and if you're not too picky, perhaps 10 years. Product lifecycle is a big issue. Upgrading a PC or a mobile phone is an extremely costly experience, not just because of the direct costs, but more importantly the time cost. For someone who is choosy on the configurations of PC or phone, switching to a new device is extremely time-consuming. In my own experience, every time when I got a new PC, it would cumulatively cost me a minimum of 20 hours to set everything up to meet my particular requirements. This is mostly system, desktop environment and software configuration. A lot of tweaking is necessary on a new PC. Fortunately, Android has made switching to a new phone a lot easier than switching to a new PC. Most of the switch including app installation, data transfer, and system configuration are made automatic. But not everything, especially when you use many apps that require personalized settings and data configuration. So still, it would take several hours to get everything right. I'm hoping to hold onto the Pixel XL 2 for at least a few years.",,Google,"Google Pixel 2 XL 64 GB, Black (Renewed)"

It is not perfect but it does its job very well. Here is a breakdown of what I can say positive and negative about the phone . Pros: Great Battery Life (better than the iphone x and the note 8) Great Camera (Best Camera I've seen in a smartphone.

Great thing they included the transfer cable to transfer all your pictures from your iphone to this device) Fingerprint reader ( Very Responsive and great placement ) Large Screen IP67 certification (better than nothing, similar rating to the iphone X) Unlimited Google Cloud Storage for 2 years (Original Quality) Makes up for not having the expandable storage. VR Ready with your google daydream Cons: No Wireless Charging Screen looks great but viewing angles are horrible Blue Tint precense ( gets better when you change the display setting to Saturated but there are better looking screens out there) No IP68 certification Expensive ( you can get it cheaper with a carrier or getting it online from a third party) No expandable Storage (you have 64gb and 128gb options , the bigger options goes for an additional $100) Ouch! Would I recommend this over the iphone X or the Galaxy S9 or the Galaxy Note 8 ? Yes.

It doesn't come with some of the fancy extra features preinstalled like some other phones, but almost every extra features that any other phone might have, you can get in a app. It has impressive stats, and sits in the top 5 best smart phones in 2018 (a year after it was released), next to huge brand name phones that were just released. And, the raving reviews about the picture quality are correct. Most professional reviews rate it as the best smart phone camera available.

I was able to pull my TracFone sim card directly out of my old iPhone and plug it into this one and everything worked seamlessly with no issues or need to call anyone at TracFone. While downloading all of my contacts and apps, the phone did get a little warm, but enough to cause concern. So far the battery life seems fairly comparable to my last phone (iPhone 6s with a new battery), about two days with minimal internet/streaming use, and I imagine at least a day if you were playing a lot of games or doing a lot of streaming. The camera quality is also comparable to my iPhone, possibly even a little bit better. I've been so impressed with this phone, that I plan to get my husband one as well.

B07HKPMFZ5,Tampa Buyer,5,"June 25, 2019",True,Great deal and perfect phone - no eSim,"I received a mint phone that appeared to be new. It had a Google charger and cable, a headphone dongle , a usb adapter, and a sim tool. There were no signs of wear or use. The phone is unlocked and the Verizon version. Verizon stupidly disabled the eSim, so that is the only feature missing compared to the Google version for most people. The bootloader is also locked on Verizon phones, but unless you are a developer it would be fairly senseless to flash your own rom on these if you even knew how. Back to the disabled eSim - its not really a big deal except for one thing - I keep a Google Fi eSim in my phone for travel, so in essence the Google Pixel 3 lines is dual sim sort of, so when Verizon disabled the eSim they killed the dual sim feature. This phone was for my wife who doesn't need the eSim. So the bottom line is - if you don't need the eSim, and you won't unless you want two sims at once, its a beautiful phone at the lowest price online I have seen.

There are other companies out there that produce amazing hardware and software spec phones for low prices. But I stumbled upon Amazon and saw the low price for the refurbish pixels. And I got to say. This phone is amazing! I have read through a couple of other reviews on these phones on how some, unfortunately, didn't get the chance to have a good experience. Due to problems with the phone itself. I don't have a problem with the phone itself and so far I didn't have any problems with the phone, but if you ever do buy a pixel and you start having problems. Be sure to return the product and ask for another one. Everything about the phone from the camera, hardware, up to the user experience its great! I am actually very happy to have this phone.

Was it spy on me? 3. At the beginning, when the battery reaches 1%, I still can use it for 2 hours. But after 2 months, the phone auto turn off when battery is 2%. 4. Why the camera keep ""motion on"" by default? Does it use extra memory? Personally I dislike that feature. It took me a long time to figure out how to turn that feature off. Good points: 1.

This is coming from a person who was burned...(TWICE)... by Google and the Pixel 1's faulty microphone. However I'm a forgiving kind of guy and man am I glad I got over my first experience with Pixel devices and ordered this one! Ok, so what's so good about this phone, huh? EVERYTHING! The phone is super fast and snappy with any APP I use. I'm a heavy gamer and this phone has been able to easily play any games IV thrown at it. Plus they look amazing with the screen in this phone. The OLED screen is such a treat for my eyes. Deep, rich, and vibrant...I love watching movies with it! And I know you've all heard about the ""hideously huge notch"" and how it just ruins everything..... Well, I barely notice it. In fact there are some neat apps that can do some really cool things with the notch like putting a color changing strip around it that will work as notification alert or battery bar. And that leads perfectly to the next great thing, the battery. I am a very heavy user and the battery will last me almost the entire day. The speed charger is blazingly fast so if I should have to plug it in before the days up, it only takes about 10-15 mins to get 25-30%. Then there's the fact that Pixel users get all the updates first. I love rubbing that in Samsung users faces! Let's see....what am I forgetting..... Ahhh yes, saved the best for last. The camera. There aren't words to describe how damn good the camera really is. I still can't believe a cellphone can take pictures like this. Blows my mind. It has actually inspired me to take up photography as a hobby. Not to mention Google will backup and store an UNLIMITED amount of photos and videos for FREE! Yeah, yeah, I know I sound like Googles little fanboy. Hell I admit I am. No shame here! Just go ahead and get this phone and I promise you'll be a fanboy/fangirl too! Theres alot of other great features to this phone that I haven't mentioned so I guess you'll just have to get one and see for yourselves. Trust me you won't regret it! Oh yea, I did buy mine refurbished and it looked like new. Not a scratch on it. the only difference was it came without the original charger. But it refurbed and save yourself few bucks.

I did pay am extra 15-20 over the cheapest seller. But I figured there was a reason for the higher rating. The phone arrived with a brand new screen protector pre installed. Looks flawless!

B07HKPMFZ5,Federico Grijalba,4,"August 9, 2019",True,"Best camera phone, even 1 year after release","I bought this phone one year ago, coming from a Pixel 1. Not to make the review long because there are plenty reviews on YouTube: PROS 1. That camera. Easy to use, great detail, amazing dynamic range, very nice portrait effect and fast. I encountered no issues with it like some other people said. Maybe Google updated the cam app. Moreover, the wide angle selfie camera is a plus. 2. Smartness. This phone is packed with AI features. For example: it records all songs it heard, even if I didn't ask for it. 3. Squeeze for Google Assistant. If you like GA, this is a very quick and handy feature. 4. Front facing speakers. Compared with Pixel 1, the front facing speakers are a beauty. Strong and sound very well. 5. Beautiful screen. This is sharp and colorful. CONS: 1. Relatively slow processor. Don't get me wrong, I like how fast it is, and for my daily basis this is OK. But some heavy apps may result a bit slow for some people, especially comparing the phone to other newer ones like OnePlus 7 Pro. 2. Low RAM. 4 gb is not enough sometimes. For example, opening several apps at the same time and then switching between them is slow. 6 gb would have been much much better. 3. Back easily scratched. But can be solved easily with any case. 4. Screen not very bright. Noticeable while being outside. 5. Notch. I'm already used to it, but it can bother some picky people. Overall, I can say I bought the phone for the camera. I don't really care about anything else. If the processor can handle texting, web browsing, playing music smoothly I'm happy.

B07HKPMFZ5,Demontre Abramson,5,"July 14, 2019",True,Premium Flagship Phone with out the pricetag,Fast and functional with an amazing camera. There were no scratches or defects with my phone. Took it to get activated at a Metro PCS with no issues. The battery doesn't last as long as my LG Stylo 4. It does say that the battery may be reduced to 85%. of full capacity so I'll chalk it up to that. Google Assistant is convenient but not overwhelming. The camera is as advertised. Night Sight mode is ridiculously beautiful. Took a photo in a dark cave and it came out so amazing. All in all it feels good to have premium flagship phone without having to pay full price.

B07HKPMFZ5,Guitarand,1,"May 2, 2019",False,Manufacturer's Warranty is a CHEAT!,"My wife cracked her screen and put in a Verizon insurance claim to get it repaired. However, uBreakiFix said they couldn't repair it because there was an internal PART MISSING. This was clearly a MANUFACTURING DEFECT. I reached out to Verizon and escalated the issue, but they declined to help and sent me to Google tech support. Google also declined saying that I'd need to get the screen fixed before they could help, which left me in a catch-22. So, bottom line, I was sold A DEFECTIVE PHONE and was forced to pay a replacement phone deductible ($199) to get it replaced. I suspect the uBreakiFix contract may have been specifically setup to ensnare customers into paying the full deductible when the screen breaks, while Google manufacturing cut corners on their phones, all so they can't be fixed. I wonder how many more Pixel 3XL phones have this defect and people are stuck paying the high deductible. THIS IS A CHEAT! Shame on Google and Verizon! I will never again buy another Google phone and am seriously considering dumping Verizon after 20+ years of loyalty. So much for the manufacturer's warranty.

No adapter for carrying over my information, no headphones so I can't listen to sound since this phone requires the new USB C headphones, and finally I can't even use the phone because there is no way to charge it once it's battery runs out.

B07HKPMFZ5,Amazon Customer,5,"August 26, 2019",True,F A N T A S T I C Phone!,"I've owned four iterations of the iPhone and another five Androids, including the Moto Droid Maxx, the Galaxy SIII and S5, and the Note 2 before the most recent Galaxy S7, so I have a solid base of experience in this field. Pros: Excellent battery life, strong and durable, blazing fast, gorgeous large screen/, amazing camera, utilization of the USB-C reversible charge cable. I love this phone and have been nothing short of impressed with it through two months of use. The battery can last 14 hours with moderate to heavy use. I am a photography nut and the camera blows me away consistently. I'm also something of a stickler on the display and the screen is incredible. Cons: No headphone port, which is only a con if you use headphones. No back/menu buttons. I've been using the S7 for close to three years and have always had the back button on my androids. This one eliminates that feature and through two months of use, I still haven't got used to it not being there. The phone isn't truly unlocked. I haven't figured out how to use tethering with this phone on my StraightTalk plan even though I could do it on my old S7. I keep getting ""you aren't subscribed to this service"" and no apps seem to have the workaround. Conclusion: Great phone, especially for this price point. Refurbished condition is only evident in the fact they ship it in a plain cardboard box instead of a fancy Google box.",1.0,Google,Google Pixel 3 XL 64GB Unlocked GSM & CDMA 4G LTE Android Phone w/ 12.2MP Rear & Dual 8MP Front Camera - Just Black (Renewed)
B07HKPMFZ5,MEA,5,"December 7, 2019",True,Very satisfied,"This review is more about my experience of buying a renewed phone, rather than the phone itself. I purchased this phone to replace my pixel, and the *only* reason I was replacing that was because of the rapid battery drain. I didn't want to spend the money on a new pixel 4 because I'm not impressed with the battery reviews on it. My choices were to replace my pixel battery ($100) or buy a renewed phone for a couple of hundred more than I would have spent to replace the pixel battery. I started watching these renewed pixel 3xls to see how the pricing was going. I didn't want to spend more than $400, so I kept waiting and waiting. Then a 128gb one came up for $367, which I thought was a really good price. I ordered it on a Tuesday, it said it would be here the following Monday, but it arrived during the day on Friday. Yeah! The packaging was really good, the phone was secure. The phone was in a bag in the box, and in the box was also a charger and cable. The phone was not charged, but no biggie. It charged really fast. The one thing I noticed after inspection, was two scratches in the top third of the phone. I was so bummed! Now I knew why the phone was so much less. However, you can only see the scratches at a certain angle and when the screen is off. I can't feel them when running my finger over. So, another decision: can I live with the scratch that is only visible under certain angles, and angles that I would be unlikely to ever hold my phone at and when the screen is off, or do I send it back? I decided to charge it up, install my stuff and see how it goes. Well, the scratches aren't a big deal at all. There is no interference with my phone interaction/useability. It's a trade off, but I think a worthwhile trade off - this is the only physical flaw on the phone. I plan to keep this one until around pixel 6 or so, so again, I think it's worth it. I'm very happy I got a really good deal, and other than the scratches, I feel like the phone is brand new.",,Google,Google Pixel 3 XL 64GB Unlocked GSM & CDMA 4G LTE Android Phone w/ 12.2MP Rear & Dual 8MP Front Camera - Just Black (Renewed)
B07HKPMFZ5,MarCarp,4,"August 27, 2019",True,'Renewed' looks and functions as if brand new.,"I recently purchased this renewed Pixel 3 XL to replace my (very) aging Samsung Note 3. I'm not going to rave about the performance increase for obvious reasons. I will say that I find the usability (UI) of the Pixel 3 vs the Note 3 to be so delightful. It's simple, fluid, and intuitive. It's really nice to no longer have TouchWiz encapsulating the basic Android UI experience. I didn't realize just how intrusive TouchWiz was until it wasn't there. My Pixel 3 XL came in a white box with an Amazon Basics charger and charge cable. The cable works fine. I have not tested the charger since I use a charge station. The phone itself looks absolutely perfect. No scuffs, scratches, not even a fleck of dust on it. I was able to transfer my contacts via online back up without issue. The camera is amazing, which I realize goes without saying. A quick comment on battery life, I only lost 2% overnight with both wifi and 4G turned ON. My Note 3 will lose almost 20%-30% under similar conditions (even with the new battery that I have for it). Overall, my first impressions are very, very positive. Hopefully time will be as kind to my Pixel 3 XL as it was to my Note 3.",1.0,Google,Google Pixel 3 XL 64GB Unlocked GSM & CDMA 4G LTE Android Phone w/ 12.2MP Rear & Dual 8MP Front Camera - Just Black (Renewed)

It feels more solid and is faster. It would be even better if Google hadn't copied Apple's silly notch at the top. How about some originality Google? My only complaint is that Amazon only gives a 90 day warranty with their renewed products. Why so short? If the unit WAS actually renewed back up to original specs, then it should be offered with the full manufacturer warranty.

B07HKPMFZ5,Shawn Parker,1,"March 18, 2019",False,Stay away from Google Pixel 3,"My recommendation is to stay away from Google phones! I do admit that the camera on Pixel 3 is better than iPhone in most lighting situations but the lack of customer service is not worth the gamble for such an expensive phone. The software crashed after a few days of usage and the retailer refused to take responsibility for exchange or refund or repair. Google has no support in any of the 20 countries I have traveled to since purchasing the phone and their website offers no convenient solutions without shipping the phone to a service center in Singapore or US. I am not sure how Google thinks this is an efficient way to deal with software issues, but I am not the customer who can afford to be without my main phone for 6 weeks. The two year warranty they offer is as good as no warranty in my opinion and Google should not be charging these prices if they have not figured out their license problems internationally.

B07HKPMFZ5,Wayne Cannon,4,"February 28, 2019",False,Cannot charge phone and use headphones at the same time (both require the USB port),"Great phone overall; however, there are two minor annoyances. There is no separate headphone jack -- everything uses the USB-C port. This means that you cannot charge the phone's battery and use headphones at the same time, since they both require the single USB port. The supplied ear buds have a USB-C connector. There is a USB-C to 3.5 mm headphone adapter, so you can use regular headphones. For what it's worth, the supplied ear buds use a slightly stiffer loop in the cable that fits inside the earlobe, which I find much more comfortable and better-retained than traditional ear buds. The back of the phone is so slippery that it will not sit in place on even a very slight (e.g., two-degree) slope without sliding off -- e.g., an open notebook in front of my computer screen. This makes a protective cover mandatory for me, which is not a problem since I have a cover.",4.0,Google,Google Pixel 3 XL 64GB Unlocked GSM & CDMA 4G LTE Android Phone w/ 12.2MP Rear & Dual 8MP Front Camera - Just Black (Renewed)

Obviously you’re taking a gamble with something like that but in my case, the phone arrived basically as if it was brand new! No scratches, no scuffs, no dents, you name it. Checked the battery info and said it’s last charge was over 83 days ago, so it’s been quite some time since it’s been used. I’m pretty certain the unit I got was hardly used to begin with from the previous owner. USB-C cable, charging brick, SIM injector, audio dongle, and USB adapter were all included as described in great condition, no damage from what I could tell. I know other users have expressed that their devices came mildly damaged or with some scratches here and there, so take my experience with a grain of salt. That being said, the Pixel 3 is an amazing device and at a price like this, you really can’t go wrong at all. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone!

Your app drawer is just one long page of apps that you swipe up through. The stock messaging app is terribly unreliable. I felt like I went back in time because I found myself in the app store trying to find a SMS app that would actually send and receive my pictures and messages. It's been telling me to restart the phone to finish installing Android 9 since day one. Doesn't matter how many times I actually do that, it doesn't change anything. I can't get it to properly pair with my Galaxy watch and my voicemail (at&t) won't work with it. I have to go of school and call my own number to check my messages and press 7 to delete (remember that? 😆) because any other route gets me a ""this number is no longer in service"" message.

It came in a black box, sealed in a plastic bag and only missing one accessory - the micro-usb to usb-c adapter. The rest was there. It took my SIM card and worked like a charm. It's a clean phone that is quite sprite with a crisp display and nice sound (for multimedia content.) My only real complaint is the sound for the ringtone and notifications (mind you these are both controlled by the same volume slider.) Not sure why, but it sounds like it uses a different speaker as it is more muffled than the multimedia stuff. The battery is fair, wish it would last longer, but it seems on par with other phones so this is not a complaint. Overall, it works great and was such a better deal than buying the Pixel 3a for more money.

Within a minute it was down to 3%. I tried resetting multiple times and the same problem occured. It's been stuck on 3% for the last half hour!! Plugging it in does nothing. So stressful.

What has surprised me is the quality of the camera--both the front selfie camera and the rear. The selfie camera takes better pictures than most selfie photos I've seen. Plus, it has a wide angle option, which is very helpful when you have a larger group or scene you want to fit. It only has one lens on the rear camera, but it does a surprisingly good job with portrait photos. The battery does not seem to last as long as I'd like--less than a day, I'd estimate, especially when it's uploading photos regularly.

My personal phone and my work phone are on the same cellular carrier, so that shouldn't be the root of any of the problems with the Pixel 3. My old $150 budget phone outperforms the Pixel 3 in every way that I use a phone. I use the Pixel 3 for only 4 things: calls, texts, navigation, and email. I have very few apps on this phone, but the battery barely lasts a day, and I've tried to turn down the brightness, disable unused apps, etc, but nothing seems to solve the poor battery life. There is also some crazy lag in the driving navigation. I've missed a few turns due to the extreme lag. One time I was at a stoplight, and the Pixel 3 said ""In 1000 feet, turn right."" The right turn was supposed to be for the intersection I was already sitting at. I thought maybe some of the problems were due to the phone being so new and downloading updates or something while I was trying to use it, but after a couple months it still has terrible lag. I'm also unable to read some of my emails because the Pixel 3 will automatically undo scrolling for some reason, and you should do an internet search about this issue, I'm not the only one having this problem. There are a ton of other little irritations that have made me want to put this phone in the garbage can, but I don't remember them right now.

The Pixel 3 camera In my opinion is amazing but the battery Is terrible. I use my phone all day, I walk to and from work listening to music and sometimes have to use my phone at work as well. Being able to charge my phone at work and the fact that I carry a power bank keeps the battery going fine but I really shouldn't have to do that If they just put a better battery In the phone. Now the fact that the battery does not last long presents more problems for me. The charging port Is also where the headphones go so I cannot listen to music and charge my phone at the same time unless I buy a splitter which means more things I have to carry and potentially lose. You could always argue that I could get wireless headphones but since I travel a lot having more chargers to carry and more things to charge Is a awful Idea. I've also thought about using battery cases but then I can't use my headphones while the battery pack Is on so I may as well stick with the power bank since it holds more power.

The Pixel 3 is quick, and it's cameras are really impressive. But then Google crippled the phone to sell its own accessories. If you buy any Qi charger but Google's, it will only slow charge and not use the 7.5W or 10W fast charging feature. So if you want fast wireless charging, the $15 Qi chargers on Amazon will charge slow, while the $80 Pixel one will do the full 10W. It also crippled screen mirroring through USB C Thunderbolt cables to sell Chromecasts. And that is a crap solution, because not everything that plays video will ""Cast"". If I have presentations to give on a big monitor, that is probably not going to happen. Those two things make this phone much less useful as a travel and business companion than an S9 or S10. I can get around the first by using cable charging when I need to charge fast. I just won't be able to do the second like I used to when I had an S5. Chromecast is just not the same as plugging in an HDMI cable. If this phone were not on sale (I got the Verizon locked version for $499) I would have returned it. For a couple hundred dollars, I can accept slow wireless charging, and having to bring my tablet for presentations and to watch my online services at the hotel. Full price?

The software is weirdly unstable, I thought being stock Android would be great but no, I think it's because of the 4GB of RAM this thing has, apps keeps crashing and reloading everytime you reopen them. I am posting this on July 6th so at this moment Android Q is only available in beta. I did give it a try and it's way more stable, battery life is much better in Android Q, so I do think the phone will be great when the official version is released. But this is a Pixel, you buy this for the camera and you're not wrong. I have compared it with iPhone Xs and it's just on another level, I have even compared it with Huawei P30 Pro and Huawei only have much better zoom, Pixel is just superior with the quality of the photos. In the audio department, it sounds great, I've seen better like iPhone Xs and Asus ROG phone but it has front facing speakers with excellent quality and volume. In the screen department, this generation is like 600% better than the Pixel 2, Pixel 2 were just terrible, this one is a very nice AMOLED display, colors are good and accurate, viewing angles are also top. In the battery life, well... It's not good to be honest. I have found myself charging this thing twice a day with normal use. 3 times even with heavy use.. if you're taking a lot of photos it will just eat your battery. For example, I recorded 8 minutes of the 4th of July fireworks in NYC, it consumed 15-20% of the battery. That's just crazy. But all this little issues has been resolved with the Android Q, even it being a beta is just much more stable than the current official Android 9. If you want this Pixel, go for it.

Here are the steps I went through: 1) Turn on the phone without inserting a Sim card. 2) Skip those steps that involve connection to the Google server. 3) When the phone completes the start process, connect it to a laptop with a USB cable, and send a VPN or similar app from the laptop to the phone. I have connected the Pixel with another phone or the laptop, using bluetooth, but failed in transferring the VPN app by bluetooth. 4) Connect the Pixel to wifi, run the VPN, the Pixel can now connect to Google server. 5) Continue with other steps like inserting a Sim card, go to Google account and Google Play Store, make necessary downloads and updates, etc. An annoying issue: Even with the VPN running successfully, and hence so do the apps on the Pixel, the wifi sign keeps showing ""no internet"". I don't know how to figure out this issue. The Pixel 3XL comes with Android 9. The 10 is available, and my phone is still downloading the 10 since I set up the phone 2 days ago. 12/26/2019 Update: My phone updated to Android 10 yesterday.

The battery life though, is poor to put it nicely and 4gb of RAM in this day and age is just not acceptable. The Pixel 2 had 4gb and the new Galaxy S10+ has 8gb of RAM.

Battery life is a joke. Fully (100%) charged phone will loose 1% of battery charge right after you unlock the screen. It will loose 15-20% of battery charge overnight just sitting on your nightstand. A couple of short youtube videos (like my favourite SNL sketches) will take another 5-10%. Another problem - this so-called ""pure android experience"". Seriously, Google? Weather is disappearing from Home screen and there is no way to return it back (no it's not a joke. Search Google for ""weather disappeared from pixel screen"" and you will get 1,300,000 results - Google can't fix this issue since 2018).

I'm not going to try to regurgitate the tech specs on the phone; you can find that easily. Why the 3XL and not a version 4? For me, the decision ended up with the fingerprint reader, which this version still has. I love the ease of the rear reader and cannot understand why Google did away with it. So this was my first phone I did not get from the VZ people; and it was a snap to move the sim card from my old Pixel to this one. Took literally 4 minutes to make that change.

As others have said, there are a lot of strange little bugs that have made this phone rather frustrating to use. What has broken me, though, is my inability to use the camera in other apps. Even when I am using Google's own messaging app, the front and rear camera have this awful pixellation issue where I don't even want to use the phone anymore. With all apps, the picture is clear the moment I take it, there is a pause, then these dot artifacts appear on the screen. I have been trying to contact Google about this issue for months and have not received any information back. The whole process has been extremely frustrating and has ruined this device for me.",,Google,"Google Pixel 3, Verizon, 64 GB - Clearly White (Renewed)"

B07NLHLC88,R. Bloom,4,"December 11, 2019",True,Just like New,"Received 4 days after order, no discernible wear anywhere on phone. The Amazon receipt in box said ""Condition: New"" even though sold as renewed. Well wrapped in Amazon packing envelope, only a generic 'Smart Phone' box, but constructed from heavy/thick cardboard. Phone not secured inside box, could be rattled around but the protective plastic on screen and sides showed no wear. Included inside box: SIM tool, fast charger w/USB-C cable (5v-3a, 9v-2a), Amazon ""Certified Refurbished"" Warranty Card, Amazon shipping doc. No manual, no quick start card, no instructions what-so-ever. No ear buds, supposedly new Pixels have these, this did not. Phone came uncharged. Phone charges by computer connection, wireless on Qi base, or connected to charger. Powered on and it led user through set-up including (if replacing another phone) SIM card swap and, with use of a cable (and adapters) between old and new phones, complete transfer of all user data from the old phone. Connected to Verizon wireless immediately without prompting. That was impressive to me. This will replace my Samsung Galaxy S7 running Android Oreo; the Pixel 3 immediately updated itself to Android 10 over WiFi even before I did the SIM swap. No relying on Verizon for system updates! (That's a good thing.) After 24-hours I'm not used to it yet, some things that were stupid simple on the S7 require looking them up in the (non-existent!) manual; things like screen shots, muting the ring, switching to vibrate, connecting to computer for down/up loads. I don't care for the always on Google search/assistant at the bottom of all screens, but I guess that's the price from not having a bunch of carrier foistware on the phone that can't be removed. Very fast and responsive. Maybe it's a boomer thing, but my biggest complaint to directed to Google: there's no manual and no good books in the Amazon store. There apparently is lots of great things hidden in this phone, but limited ways to find out. Yes, there's 'help' on the phone and a webpage (not PDF) on support.google.com/pixel - but I want to know all the ins and outs and prefer not to have to watch a dozen YouTube videos or paw through reviews. Thankfully some younger friends showed me the answers to the questions above. I note the phone was not completely wiped and re-loaded; there were folders off the Android root that were definitely not mine and not Android's. These referenced DVDs and CDs that I never had. All those left-over folders, over 200 of them counting sub-folders, were empty. Maybe that's just how an Android reset works, I dunno.

The rest of the time, image quality varies greatly, and feels underwhelming mostly. - Panoramic images aren't very well processed (clearly shows the stitching points). - Low light camera is great - when using a tripod.

However, when I started setting it up, I noticed there were many problems. It turns out that none of the major sensors are working! The phone doesn't rotate when viewing videos, typing, taking pictures, etc. regardless of whether or not the auto-rotate feature is on. Moreover, the active edge (when you squeeze the phone) did not work at all no matter how much (or little) I squeezed. The ""lift to check"" and ""double tap to wake"" features also didn't work. Finally, the proximity sensor did not work during calls and the ambient light sensor failed to register differences in brightness.

It was about $300 less than the 10e so I decided to try it. (There is a 90-day return policy when you purchase a phone through Costco.) The phone has a lot of nice features but the deal breaker for me was the sound, or rather the lack of it. Even with the volume turned all the way up, it was nearly impossible to hear the audio (I was trying to listen to a podcast at the gym) anywhere but in a virtually silent environment. Also, incredibly, Google decided not to include a headphone jack but instead to provide a dongle (!!) for connecting headphones via the charging port. Aside from the fact that this is an archaic and clunky implementation, it also tends to stress the charging port. So, an otherwise pretty decent phone is not worth getting, at least in my view.

B07R7DY911,CynicalBubble2,5,"May 15, 2019",False,Overall Good Value,"This phone does as well as my Pixel 2XL did, for half the price. Pros: low cost, incredible camera, Google ecosystem, battery life, headphone jack. Cons: slightly buggy phone app, cheaper materials, not quite waterproof, lack of wireless charging, no earbuds included. I was a bit hesitant to risk upgrading, but I'm so glad that I did. I bought the 3A XL in Purple-ish, and the color is gorgeous. The battery life has been great, surprisingly better than my Pixel 2XL. Please note that I did disable some digital wellbeing features within an hour of initial setup, which has increased the speed and saved some battery. The display is nice, and bringing back the headphone jack was a pleasant surprise (I don't know about you but I was CONSTANTLY losing my 'dongle' when I actually needed it). However, there are a few major features lacking on this model vs the 3XL, primarily lack of wireless charging and waterproofing. Another major difference is the materials are definitely cheaper. It doesn't look or feel as cheaply made as say, the iPhone 5C did. The back simply doesn't have quite the same glow as the 2XL or 3XL. I would definitely recommend getting a screen protector on the device immediately before use, as the glass on the front isn't as durable. That said, it doesn't really look or feel cheap, just not built as premium as other Pixel devices. I could probably write an entire page about how incredible the camera is, but it's something you really just need to experience for yourself. Night Sight blew my mind. I took pictures of my living room in nearly pitch black darkness and a) I was able to see more in the photo than I could with my naked eye in the dark and b) it honestly looked like the time of day the photo was taken was about 4pm with the amount of light in the image. Portrait mode on any Pixel is fantastic. I have been asked if many pictures that I have taken on Pixel phones are professional photographs, and I am really not the best photographer. I do feel the need to mention that the phone app still has some kinks to work out, but I'm confident from my past experience with Google that it won't be long before its fixed. I have noticed that sometimes on calls, the phone has issues with displaying contact names on screen when I switch from one call to another. Luckily, there is an option built into the device's settings to immediately talk with Google support live agents via chat. I did this with ZERO wait time. Super helpful! Considering upgrading from an iPhone? I would recommend ignoring other online reviews that advise you against it and just go for it. (Just remember if you have a newer iPhone, make sure to compare features on your current device such as wireless charging first). My inital experience going from Apple to Google (iPhone to the Pixel 2XL) was seamless. Everything transferred via the cord and adapter given in the box. (Minus my collection of Apple music of course, but that's what Spotify is for!) New to Google? The Google ecosystem works incredibly well as a whole. I have Google smart home products in my home, and use Google photos and Gmail/google calendar/g suite etc. I'm amazed every day by new ways that everything works together. Lastly, THE PRICE! A new release, good quality phone at this low of a cost? It's a GAME CHANGER. This was the deciding factor for me choosing to upgrade, and it's absolutely worth the cost. In fact, a phone with this good of a camera at this cost is basically a steal.",510.0,Google,Google - Pixel 3a with 64GB Memory Cell Phone (Unlocked) - Just Black - G020G

B07R7DY911,Janet Bloom,3,"May 25, 2019",True,Battery may cause return,"This is my 48- to 72-hour review. I bought this to replace a Moto G4 Play that had served me well but was on its second battery and occasionally locked up on me requiring me to remove the battery to reboot. As I had become a Moto fan thanks to my G4 Play, I was looking at the G7 Play and Power. For a bit more, the G7 looked worth considering, then the Pixel 3a came out for the same price if you take the $100 gift card into account. I read several reviews, and the better camera sold me. I jumped in, taking the Amazon gift card offer over the Best Buy offer. The phone looks good, still fits in my pocket and I can easily use it with one hand. The screen looks sharp and I really like the camera after a day or two of playing a little bit. I still need to learn more about it. I LOVE the call screening feature which I'm not sure is Pixel specific or the operating system. I switched my service over Thursday night but needed a new, smaller SIM card which ATT gave me as I continued service with them. Friday, I was on the phone off and on throughout the day, mostly setting it up, adding my work email and calendar, etc. I also took a walk around my campus with it, testing out the camera on about a dozen photos. By the time I got home from work, the battery was down to 17 percent. 17! I had read that this didn't have a great battery, but that it would get me through the day. 5pm won't cut it. So, what can you decide in one day? I got up this morning, Saturday, and did some surfing, and played some online games. Now, my game playing is limited to word puzzles and backgammon, not graphics-intensive games. The battery, which was charged the night before, was down to 37 percent before noon. I'm now very concerned about using this during an upcoming trip, or relying on it for work or travel. I really like the phone, but this can't continue. I may need to return it. Is anyone else having battery problems like this. On the plus side, the included charger recharges the phone pretty quickly.

B07R7DY911,NOVA John,5,"May 17, 2019",False,Bought it on the day Google announced it,"I've never spent more than $200 on average for a phone. I paid the price with suspect quality, since I mainly bought new Android phones for that price range. Every phone didn't last more than two years, most even started to have issues after a few months (i.e. GPS losing accuracy, charging slot losing contact, etc.) Of course the OS never gets updated so you set yourself up to be hacked on an old, unpatched release. The worst is the camera varying degrees of terrible. So I bought a prepaid iPhone 6 about 1.5 years ago but you know how well iOS runs on old hardware and it will probably not make the jump to the next update. No matter how much I tried to convince myself, I just couldn't buy a new XR, even after I sold my DSLR (b/c I just never bring it with me no matter how good the pictures/lens is/was). However, when Google launched this phone, my last international family trip convinced me that I need to jump at the chance - pictures you have forever, you want the best camera/phone to capture your experiences. Plus, they are offering an insane $250 trade-in for my iPhone and $100 from the Google store credit, plus my company is giving me $100 for BYOD, so the phone is essentially free to me. Ordering was flawless, plus they (I ordered from the Google Store) provided a trade-in kit at the same time. I got it in 2 days after Google announced it. Box was your typical white box, looks almost exactly like a Apple box with color, design, packaging, etc. Phone powered right up. Slight hiccup to get it activated on Sprint in that you can't just move the nano SIM card over, you have to go to a Sprint store and activate a completely new SIM. Also make sure it's a corporate store b/c affiliates don't seem to have these SIMs. I went to Best Buy and they had me running in 20 minutes. Phone is awesome. I got the XL and it's large but for a person who wears glasses it just makes it easier to do things. I know people say it's not fast but I don't game or edit videos so it's plenty fast/responsive. Most importantly, the camera is awesome. Photos are not blurry so far and super clear. I haven't even used any of the special portrait and night options. I'm telling you if a camera can take low light photos that is golden and why I jumped at it. Even with a DSLR it's a challenge trying to take low light photos (do you have the right lens with a large aperture but then you can't have zoom, etc.) It seems pretty fragile so I'm going to get some sort of case, especially since it's plastic and the case is not removable. However, make sure you get a full case and not a case that just clips on the edges. I made the mistake of buying one for my iPhone and sand/dirt got wedged in and ended up scratching the phone itself. The Android OS is quite a bit different than iOS but I'm coping. Can't say it's worst, just different. The best part is the it being a Google phone will get updated for at least 3 years. I have no big input on the exterior design of the outside, really all phones look the same - we have Apple to blame for that. The fingerprint unlock is a huge plus and love it for all my iPads, computers. Very pleased so far (will update if that changes). Since this phone is free to me, I plan to use my $100 Google store credit to buy another Pixel 3a for my wife. She has a 2 year old Huawei Honor 8 that has held up pretty well, aside from every government in the world banning them. Update after 1 month Best phone I've ever had. Best camera I've ever had bar none, better than any Canon/Nikon DSLR I've had, etc. I've take pictures from moving buses, etc. and each pictures looks like a million bucks...the first time. I've used the camera for some professional portrait quality pictures. Battery life is great. I have had some data disconnection problems but not sure if it's a Sprint problem or otherwise but only happened a few times. I'll monitor to see if it is a real issue. I did end up buying a second 3a XL for spouse and she loves it too, still waiting for my google credit though... 6 months update Here is my update on both my wife and my experience after almost 1/2 a year. So we both have Pixel 3a XL's. Overall, they have been awesome. Camera is awesome, no change. For anyone who just wants to point and click, there is no equal for the price (same as all the media articles). Battery life is great, no complaints. Size is great, especially for reading for those of us who need bigger fonts. So some issues. I had an issue that took a long time to resolve where I was not getting notifications of new voicemails left (using Sprint). Long story short after going to Sprint, working online with Google support, etc. the only way to fix it was to add an app called visual voicemail and sprint hub. This is counter intuitive but it took a huge amount of effort and troubleshooting to resolve. My wife, who had Best Buy setup the phone did not have any issue. She does however have data connection lost issues that is resolved by restarting and I have had it also but not as often. Essentially, the phone stops talking to the Internet. I'm going to try to reset the phone to resolve and then will escalate to Google if it doesn't resolve. Overall, still very pleased with the phones.",206.0,Google,Google - Pixel 3a with 64GB Memory Cell Phone (Unlocked) - Just Black - G020G

B07YMNLXL3,Ricochet,3,"October 24, 2019",True,Pixel4 - On The Fence With This One - Google Has Cut One too Many Corners Here,"Have been using Android over 10 years and carrying Pixels the last 4 years. Love stock Android. I don't usually buy phones at launch, but I caved this year. Don't care about the camera, but if this is important for you, look no further. Like it's predecessors, this phone takes nice photos. Cool design, premium feel, and a modestly updated feature set. Android is still Android after all. The phone does feel good in your hand. Screen is very nice and the 90hz refresh is noticeably smooth. If you've been reading reviews, you've probably read all this elsewhere. I do want to like this phone and am going to give it a chance, but I'm going to be merciless if the device doesn't stand up to reasonable everyday use. What do I mean by this? We bought two phones but I've only opened one of them to evaluate. Set up was easy. Connect your devices and less than 10 min later, everything was transferred. Apps installed, then they updated. Ready for testing. WiFi and Bluetooth connection were fast and solid. One thing I was quite impressed with was the sound. After using earlier pixels with front firing speakers I was a little worried. Nothing to worry about here. Sound quality is very good (full and rich), and the gesture navigation skip forward and back worked for me as well, boom! 4K videos looked good and so did ones shot in 1080p. Face unlock. This was another ""on the fence"" item for me. Cool feature and it works, but now they have it all. Our fingerprints from the last generation of phones can now be linked with our faces. Works perfectly in pitch black darkness. Infrared wins. I still have the same (major) concerns as others. The 2800mah battery is tiny. I am extremely skeptical here, but hope I can be proven wrong. No unlimited original res photo storage. I know Google is in business to make money, but what a chump thing to do. It's right up there with them not including a headphone adapter or headphones this time around. So this is the price you pay or accessories you forego to have the latest tech. I believe this could have been done better or differently. It's a flagship phone, or at least that's what Google is calling it. Congrats Google, you've cut just about every corner you possibly could with this device. What's next. Let's see how the device performs in real day-to-day usage. In the car, in a pocket with Bluetooth and the normal stuff we all do with our devices. The TINY subpar battery had better be good. Otherwise 2 of these phones are coming right back to you. My suggestion, if you didn't jump on the launch deal is WAIT. The phone is nice, but the potential for disappointment is there. Black Friday and Christmas are just around the corner too. ***Update Daily use Call and audio quality is good, using a BT headset also good. Streaming music to the cars audio system working well. Android 10 has a few quirks, but is working and very stable. I haven't had any performance issues with the device or its OS. Although I had WiFi calling on my 3XL (AT&T) , it will not activate on this device. May I have to call them to see why. ***Update after 3 weeks of ownership While I am fully sold on the Face Unlock feature, I still miss the finger print reader. Its just something you become used to after years of pixel ownership. I've only caught myself trying to unlock the phone about 3 times with my finger. I set up face unlock without glasses, but it works when I put on reading glasses, and also while wearing sun glasses (that one is amazing). One thing people and (google) haven't thought of. Currently, Face Unlock works even your eyes are closed. Google has said they are going to release an update that addresses this. Ok, so what happens when I'm wearing sunglasses? Trusted Devices or Places will probably address this. My phone stays unlocked in the car and at home or work. But if you are outside walking around and wearing sun glasses, you might have to PIN into the device or lift your sunglasses. This is still an unknown I guess. I called AT&T and we determined the IMEI of the phone was not ""whitelisted"" on their network. Hence the reason why I couldn't activate Wi-Fi calling. It took them 3 days, but they re-provisioned the SIM (remotely) and added the ID. Wi-Fi Calling works now. If you have this problem with a new phone (any brand) that is compatible with voLTE and Wi-Fi calling, but was not purchased through your carrier (subsidy) there is always a possibility that the phone will not be ""whitelisted"". You have to call customer care and be really nice. I got lucky the first time I called, sometimes it takes more than one call. The second device (other P4) which is also with AT&T (but a different plan) will not allow Wi-Fi to be activated either, so this means another call to the carrier. Hand off between Cellular and Wi-Fi or vice versa works 98% of the time. I've had a few dropped calls say when I'm walking into work or the house and the phone transitions from Cellular to Wi-Fi. Mostly however, it works and is stable. For those who have had Google Fi, you'll know exactly what I am talking about. Wi-Fi calling capable devices attempt to switch aggressively whenever they can move voice calls to Wi-Fi. The new Google Assistant is very good. The AI they have built into the core of the OS is impressive. Not needing a cellular or Wi-Fi connection to use it makes it extremely fast. For me, this is probably the most notable upgrade from a Android/hardware perspective. BIGGEST concern >> the 2800mah battery. Remarkably, the phone lasts all day and well into the next morning without being charged. I had concerns about going to sleep with a low battery and having the phone die during the night and then no alarm in the morning. Well, it hasn't been a problem. I typically have 17-30% percent remaining in the morning and can easily throw the phone on charge before leaving the house. I have the ""always on"" display turned on, and allow all notifications to display on my lock screen. I have gesture navigation enabled which keeps the soli radar chip active and looking for gestures above the device when its stationary. I stream videos and play music over Bluetooth in the car. I also use navigation when walking frequently. Normal use and the battery has held up well. This is really a matter of personal preference and your usage. Initial reviews said 3-4 hrs of screen time should be expected. I'm getting 5-6hrs. If you are on your phone for hours a day, or play games, get the XL. In closing, I have found myself >>inconvenienced<< more than once since the phone did not come with a USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapter. I have headphones, but have been left to work one handed because I don't have my BT headset with me. Google > BIGGEST CHUMP MOVE EVER. Really pissed me off. I've ordered one. Tired of the inconvenience. With that said, my original recommendation stands. If you cannot buy the P4 or XL at a serious discount, WAIT. It is not worth the full retail price, regardless of the new ""features"". Its over priced for what you get, and Google has cut way too many corners seriously detracting from the value you receive vs. cost of the device at full price. Still 64GB of storage, small 2800mah battery, no adapters, no headphones, no unlimited full res photo storage.. Other people have said this too. Google has had several chances to build and release good devices. They just can't get it right. You pay for a flagship and there is always a compromise. In the case of the P4, its one after another. ***Final Update 6 weeks of ownership. I am enjoying the phone and it's working as I intended. I had Android 10 on my 3XL so no surprises there. As usual Google continues to improve and refine it's OS. Everything just works. This is why I buy Pixels. While I like the phone, this years Pixels did not wow me like those of previous years. It's a phone, it's running the latest version of Android but that's about it. The new AI built into the Google Assistant remains the most noteable ""feature"" from an upgrade perspective for me. But like before, that's it. The premium price tag is just disproportional to the value you are receiving. I am a fan of Android, but this year Apple and OnePlus nailed it from a hardware perspective. Cost to value ratio. They came through where you (Google) failed. The P4 isn't even 2 months old and most carriers are practically giving them away. Not to mention Google has substantially increased trade in values for older devices to entice new buyers. Which leads me to ask.. Google are you giving up on Pixel? Does this mean Samsung and OnePlus devices for everyone next year. Man you guys got some black eyes this year. All avoidable too. I can say this. Nice phone, but I won't buy your device at launch next year. Everyone, I urge you to heed these words. Do not pay full price for this device. I'm not saying don't buy it, but don't buy it at full price.",405.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked

B07YMNLXL3,JoHn,4,"October 30, 2019",False,Pixel 4 XL vs Samsung Note 10?,"So I was lucky enough to use both phones for a while and here are my thoughts : Display: The thing you use the most really on any phone now is the screen, the note 10 has an amazing screen & I never expected any phone to have better screen to look at. Well, the Google Pixel did just that! I dunno if it's the cleaner software or what, but the Pixel's screen does feel a little nicer. Camera: While the Pixel should have been the clear winner here, it really isn't! Yes, the front selfie camera, at night or indoor is definitely better, but honestly it feels worse than last year's Pixel 3 for some reason. The selfies feel a little fake, and the camera angles are weird. The back camera however isn't much better than the Note, in fact I find myself missing the wide angle camera that I had on my Note, a lot! On a side note, my wife's iPhone 11 pro back camera also feels a little better than the Pixel's, which is also unexpected Half star off really, not for a bad camera, but for the disappointment, it's just not as good as expected. Software: No need to bother comparing here, the Google software is much better, cleaner, smoother & more productive than that of Samsung, hands down the Pixel OS wins here. Battery: Not that much of a difference, the Note 10 does tend to last longer. Both aren't that great though but the Note will give you, may be, a couple more extra hours, which is appreciated really! Design: The Note 10 is beautiful! Very slick, all screen display, nice curvy sides, while the pixel does look good overall, specially the back, but the front design is ugly, and I don't care if they have a radar on the front, it really doesn't seem to be that much more functional and I would rather have the fingerprint scanner with an all edge to edge display, thinner phone, than the secure face ID with a big top hinge. Another half star off for a lazy design. The face ID itself is worth mentioning, it's surprisingly accurate and fast, but so many apps don't support it yet and having to enter passwords for banks & stuff seems like something that we had left behind, but with the lack of fingerprint and the lack of face id support on so many Android app, there really are no other options, try not to forget those passwords, you'll be in trouble! Overall, I think I'll be keeping my Pixel for a little while longer but I can't say I'm fully happy with it really.",58.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked

B07YMNLXL3,Tampa Buyer,5,"November 27, 2019",True,"5 stars, but the jury is still out","So far after just a week I am going to stay with 5 stars. If that changes I will update the review. Its not perfect, but overall the good outweighs the bad. So here are my notes. Its the only Android I would consider because of security and Google updates. I would only ever buy an unlocked Apple or a Google phone - where the software vendor pushes the updates every month. Otherwise I'm not interested. If you buy another Android phone good luck getting major OS upgrades or even security patches. First, all the nitpicks about battery life: Yeah, its a small phone. Its not like Google put in a small battery just to mess with you. So far, it seems about the same as my Pixel 3 to me: just ok. Unless you work mostly in the wilderness its not really an issue just top off during the day occasionally. (I hike a lot in the wilderness, and I carry a battery pack for those times). So if you need guaranteed all day battery life buy the XL. OK that aside, its a bit faster than my Pixel 3. I noticed one web page in particular that is grossly javascript heavy would load very slowly on my pixel 3 and is much faster on my 4. I’m not a huge fan of the face unlock so far. The old fingerprint reader worked better for me most of the time – you could unlock it as you picked it up. Now I have to wait till I look at it. But I got over that. Its not bad either, and occasionally its better – Lastpass for example, unlocks itself. And heh, lets get real about the flaw that you can have your eyes closed. They plan to fix this, and its really not much less secure than a fingerprint as is. If you are sleeping or dead either one can be bypassed,. The size if just right I don’t want a giant phone. Likewise gestures took a bit of practice. I hate Iphones because of the no back button problem; now I don’t have one either. There is a swipe gesture instead, but its a little slower and less reliable than the old way. Still, I am resisting the temptation to enable the back button so far. The dual sim capability is amazing! I keep a Google Fi eSim onboard with Visible (Verizon MVNO) as my main carrier. The Pixel 4 does a dramatically better job of managing dual sims and either number rings now. Most of all I appreciate the Google commitment to privacy and security. (I could care less how many times they market my web history to advertisers, it doesn’t compromise my security.) I am disappointed I no longer get free full resolution camera uploads but can live with the free high resolution. And really, no earbuds included? Although I am very happy not to have the antiquated headphone jack and I have the google earbuds leftover from previous pixels which are great. I appreciate Amazon having the black Friday sale price of $599 and an extended return period in case it dies! So this phone is a keeper for me. I’ve had almost every Google phone ever made going back to day 1, and they just get a bit better with each iteration.",15.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked
B07YMNLXL3,Rob P,1,"December 3, 2019",True,At $399 this phone would still be overpriced,"I had been waiting for this phone ever since details were leaked just before summer. Then the specs were leaked - 6gb OK fair enough. 90hz screen fantastic. 2 camera lenses ok maybe. Snapdragon 855 instead of 855 plus bit disappointing but not enough to stop the purchase. Then they release the pricing - same ballpark as the iphone. OK sure it's a google phone, probably has the same quality as the iphone right? No, wrong. It feels cheap compared to an iphone, it looks cheap compared to an iphone. The ridiculous uncentered screen is dim compared to an iphone. Honestly this phone looks like a 2017 model year phone, not 2019. But then again it's made by HTC which should tell you everything you need to know right there. The spec is a joke, 64gb storage, no free google photo uploads - they are trying to be apple without providing the excellent hardware. Android 10 is great but STILL it has stuttering scrolling even with a 90hz screen. Anyone who says different is kidding themselves, IOS scrolls liquid smooth without resorting to a 90hz refresh rate. The whole radar chip gesture navigation is a total gimmick waste of hardware and resources and screen real estate. No one is going to use it in its current iteration. Android 10 telephony support is inferior to IOS - you can make whatsapp calls from favorites in IOS dialer - not an option in Android 10. Android 10 updates SUCK, even with pixel, the company phone you are only guaranteed 3 years of updates while apple gives you 5.

However, that said, I think I should offer another perspective that isn't nearly as negative. In general, I think the reviewers were too harsh. Some of them even had me on the brink of canceling my order. Glad I didn't. I have the 64GB XL. Battery life - I am not seeing much difference from my Pixel 3. The horrible battery life mentioned in some reviews is not my experience. I consider myself an average smartphone user. I'm not a 16 year old on social media all day and I don't play games. I use it all day at work (email, text, in car for music, reading some blogs with videos, the occasional call) and a little at night. When I get home, I have over 50% left. I keep the always-on display on, I use motion sense, all the connection methods are on. The key here is that I don't see a big difference from my past phones. Also - you have to give the Android OS time to use its adaptive battery function to manage various aspects of the phone. It learns your usage patterns and adjusts. This results in better battery life. I saw many reviews where the author didn't give it time. HD Calling on AT&T - I bought this unlocked model on Amazon and when I swapped my SIM out, HD calling works normally. There might be an issue with corporate accounts but search the web and look at what some people did to circumvent it. This is an AT&T issue, not Google's. Motion Sense - no, it doesn't have a lot of active functionality yet, only track skipping and alarm snoozing (which is AWESOME). What many reviews fail to highlight enough is that it augments the face unlock feature by bringing your phone to attention when you reach for it. It also allows you to turn off the always-on display then have it wake only when you are near the phone. New assistant - pretty cool. Many of the basic requests are now handled on the phone, not requiring contact with Google servers. It really speeds things up. As of Nov 1, it does have little things that I hope Google works out. Face Unlock needs to be updated to prevent unlocks when your eyes are closed. It would be nice if Smooth Display (90Hz) worked more often - although, I think the display is awesome as is, it can only get better. Google is planning to fix those. More apps need to support face unlock and that's a total wildcard; depends on the app. LastPass supports it so that's sort of a gateway to your other apps. *UPDATE 11/19/19** Smooth Display (90Hz) has been corrected with the November security update. An already beautiful screen is even better now! Also - LastPass now supports Face Unlock. Finally, you can't deny this is an expensive phone. I got it for, basically, $100 off and that brought it closer to an acceptable price for me. But - it's a personal decision. You'll have to weigh the value and decide if it works for you. If you are considering this phone, I'll be honest, also consider the Pixel 3XL (or Pixel 3). Many of the new features on the 4 will make it to the 3. If you don't need to be on the cutting edge or the extra camera features, the 3/3XL is a great phone! However, you won't be disappointed by the 4XL. After a week of getting used to face unlock and the gestures, I really like this phone. NOTE ON MEMORY - My last two phones were 64GB. Prior to that, I bought 128GB. With my past two phones, I never ran out of space with 64GB. I keep several large music playlists downloaded, I upload all my images to Google Photos and delete them from my phone. Photos: No case. In a cloth case, you can hide the color for the most part if you want.",10.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked

I had heard that the ability to do this was built into Android 10, but astoundingly, Google didn't build this into their flagship phones. The use of the phone as a phone was just fine but not significantly better than my OnePlus 6t, so I put it back in the box 3 hours after I opened it and sent the phone back. There was nothing truly groundbreaking about it. Our phones are more powerful than many people's laptops.

B07YMNLXL3,Diego Carrington,4,"October 24, 2019",True,"Perfection was so close, but I guess there is always next year.","Leaks and early reviews made people know what was coming and the few details we were missing were a disappointment. Google justifies that a telephoto it's more useful than an ultra wide but when you are joining the big league of flagships you give customers the options that the market offers and in this case I think that the wide angle omission was a big miss. This and the surprise of a smaller battery compared to last year's pixel are the drawbacks that I wanted to get out of the way first. The battery is not great as people expected and on my two day use, I have had around 4 hours of screen on time. I feel like this is making a big favor to goole, and in no way this is a justification, but my smaller battery has made me rethink that probably being on my phone for 4 hours and being stressed about it is probably something I could improve and adjust on my personal time management. Normal phone use with camera use every once in a while is achievable for sure with the regular pixel 4. For me the trade-off of a smaller battery but a more manageable body compared to the XL is worth it. To combat the lack of wide angle, I luckily had a moment wide angle lens I used on my pixel 2 that I did not get rid off when I got my S10e. I can confidently say the convenience of having the lens on the phone is great, but in case of the Samsung lens the quality dropped from the main lens to the wide angle and using the awesome lens from moment doesn't decrease the quality or adds any distortion to the main lens. Having moment announce the support of the Pixel 4 gives me a wide angle and basically convert my two lens to the ideal 3 lens scenario we all wanted. I seriously recommend the products and content Moment has to anyone interested in photography. Now for the good stuff, Pixel 4 shines in what I expected and made me come back for a pixel. I went from Nexus 6p- Samsung s8 and Pixel 2 - Samsung s10 and both times I kept missing my Google phone. If rellying on a camera that will ALWAYS deliver a great photo is something you value, I don't think there is a better option than Pixel. It's more difficult to take a bad photo than it is to take GREAT one. The lack of original quality cloud backup is a bit sour, but you can still back them on a good enough quality, considering most people just like to go back and see their photos on their phones and not for a big print out where amazing quality is required. The price of Google one is also reasonable and gives enough space for original quality backup. Lastly, the screen and 90hz screen are the cherry on top of this cake. If you use your phone, you need to unlock it so having something that makes this process go this smooth because of the early waking up of the phone from the radar to scan for your face it's really wonderful. The 90hz helps on another side of our everyday use equation : scrolling CONSTANTLY. The difference is noticeable and it's something I know I will get used to. As with many other things and features, it's one of the little things techlovers appreciate and other consumers just don't care about. There is no perfect phone but Pixel constantly proved for me that there's no match for their camera and having the best Android experience is what you get. With this year's Pixel 4 you get that plus an awesome clean and finally finger print free construction, a superb pair of speakers that do not make me miss the front firing speakers of the Pixel 2 and some nifty features that scratch my geek technology itch.",8.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked

B07YMNLXL3,WhittyOne1,3,"November 30, 2019",True,Mediocre experience,"There is so much to like about the Pixel 4xl, but so much to loathe, too. I just can't get over the negatives and actually am returning it and going back to my old phone. I watched the rumors on this phone for nearly a year with anticipation and joy. Android 10 is great, and so is the pure Android experience. The camera software is excellent, too, but the lack of ultra-wide angle camera hardware and mediocre battery ended up being bigger drawbacks than I could tolerate in the end. I didn't think it would be a big deal, but after having an ultra-wide camera on my last phone, I have learned really can't go back. I tried. I used to have the Nexus 5 years ago, which was probably one of my favorite, most reliable phones of all time. But this phone just doesn't wow enough to justify the price, when others out there are sadly beating them at the hardware game. I wanted this phone to do well, but when you have been a Google die-hard since smartphones came out, and you see yourself considering an iPhone 11 Pro, then to me, that's telling. Oh yea, the phone is way more top heavy in the hand than I anticipated, and it feels like it wants to fall out of my hand often, which is also meh.",5.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked
B07YMNLXL3,Alex Milne,5,"October 25, 2019",True,The right phone for me,"I spent a few weeks researching phones and ended up going for this one. Did the new release and pre-order deal inform that decision? Certainly. But that wasn't the only factor, and after 2 days, I have no buyer's remorse (yet). The contents of the box are basic - you get a charging cable and a USB port to allow the transfer of data from your old phone, and that's it. No headphones, no dongle, no USB-C to USB cable. The phone is simple, elegant, and light. And that last is not insignificant. Among flagship phones, it's one of the smallest and lightest around, and it fits very neatly in my pocket with minimal bulk. In fact, it's been some time since I had a phone I could comfortably leave in the pocket of my pants while sitting down. The interface is smooth and fast, and while there may be slightly better screens on the more expensive flagship models, it's plenty sharp enough for me. Motion sense it is a bit of a gimmick at this stage - not many app use it yet and it isn't 100% reliable, but it's nice to be able to vaguely waft at my alarm in the morning to snooze it. It just takes less mental energy at a time when my mental energy reserves are at their lowest. It's been reliable enough so far. Another cool new feature is live caption - instant subtitles on any media the phone is playing. I tested this while watching a Thursday Night Football NFL game, and it worked well enough. The feed was a little slow and occassionally struggled with names (Case Keenum was regularly referred to as case kingdom and Stefon Diggs confused it no end, but it got most of the other names right). I often stream football with the volume off and will make good use of this feature. The main event, though, is the camera, and it doesn't disappoint. Yes, there's no wide angle lens, but the basic camera is fairly wide already. If you want full field-of-view that distorts the edges and the verticals, then maybe an iPhone11 is better, but early tests seem to vindicate Pixel's decision to go for 'telephoto' (2x zoom) instead - the zoom is excellent and the portrait mode blows most of the competition out of the water. Images are sharp, colors are represented well and the software allows you to achieve a finer finish than anyone should really expect from the sort of lens and sensor a phone can carry. The photos added to this review show night sight, 8x zoom on the staute of liberty, and a couple of pictures using portrait mode (my cat, and a macro style photo which might be my favouite so far) Battery life is generally listed as the biggest negative of the Pixel 4, but it's been fine for me. I did reduce the frame refresh rate to 60Hz and put it on dark mode (Makes no real difference to me anyway). With those changes, I was able to do 1 hour web surfing, stream an hour of video, spend 1 hour reading an e-book, plus half and hour taking photos, and half an hour listening to music over bluetooth, and at the end of the day I still had 28% battery left. All around, fairly comfortable. If you're not a high-intensity user and you're happy with dark mode and a normal refresh rate, battery shouldn't be a deal breaker. Overall, I wanted a small, light phone with an excellent camera. Now, I have one.",5.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked

Eg. battery life is perfectly adequate, bezels do not detract from anything, etc. But the omission of the fingerprint reader is unforgivable. I've used all the previous Pixel XL phones and fingerprint readers has become a mandatory feature. The quick and reliable unlocking of the phone and its use in lieu of passwords for apps are indispensable at this point. While face-unlock is a nice gimmick it is very laggy and not reliable enough. Add to this a lack of integration of face-unlock with third-party apps and we end up with half-baked feature. While I ultimately have nothing against face-unlock, it is in no way a replacement for fingerprint reader. I for one wish Google kept the fingerprint reader in addition to face-unlock and the omission is the cause for me rating the phone so low.",3.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked

As a result, I stuck mainly with Samsung and oneplus phones (most recently the note 9). This year, I finally took the plunge on the Pixel, because I felt like the hardware was finally good enough to just scrape by (more than 4 gigs of ram is nice, 90hz screen is great, and the camera makes me feel like a professional). Its been almost a month, and I don't regret it at all. The experience is wildly better when there is no bloatware or extra stuff to get through. I didn't have to disable a hardware dedicated button to a function I never used, disable apks, and change all the default apps. If you are one that does not value the software experience, though, I feel like there are a lot of other phones that you should get instead. If you cannot get it on sale like I did, then I do not think what you get is worth the price.

You get what you would expect from a Pixel, though definitely recommend getting it via a Black Friday deal (got mine for $200 off). Great camera, flexibility, best software, etc... If you are alright with being limited by brand, buy an iPhone. But if you like being able to customize to your liking, stick with Android. The face recognition is very fast, gestures are neat (though don't really find the opportunity to use them), really enjoy my alarm volume decreasing when it knows I'm reaching over to silence early in the morning. I chose the XL because Google did make one big mistake with this generation and that is the battery. I play games and use the phone all day and am at around 40 to 50% when I go to bed, so for me the XL is sufficient but I would assume the smaller version battery would be an issue. All in all, great phone. Buy it when it is discounted, get the XL to avoid battery issues and you'll be happy. One last little con is that Google didn't include headphones.

Audio quality is noticeably better. The camera is excellent. Battery life is good. I haven't had any trouble making it through the day. Keep in mind there is no headphone jack. The wireless charging works well even with a Spigen case on it. The squeeze for Google Assistant feature hasn't been super helpful, but it may just require a change in usage habits. The same is true for Motion Sense. I haven't dunked it underwater yet, but it should survive for at least 30 minutes at up to 3 ft. deep.

B07YMNLXL3,Matthew Brewbaker,1,"December 19, 2019",True,2nd Google phone in 8 months. Neither is fully operational.,"I purchased a Google Pixel 3 on March 11, 2019. Within the first 3 months I noticed freezing when the phone would get hot, mostly when plugged in charging. As time went on, the problem got worse. at the 7 month mark, I reached out to Google support and they advised that I would need to take my device to a repair center (ubreakIfix) and pay for any necessary repairs out of pocket. This was devastating, as I had a OnePlus 1 device for 4-5 years prior to upgrading to the Pixel 3. Of course, the OnePlus 1 was a $299 phone from an unknown company at the time and it was extremely reliable, still to this day working without issue. I declined to spend more money on the Pixel 3, but with it being such a great device (when it worked), I decided to purchase a Pixel 4, although I felt wronged by Google's unwillingness to help with a device I purchased just 7 months prior. Now I've got my Pixel 4 and I'm thrilled to have a phone that won't just freeze in the worst situations, like the Pixel 3 did. The 2nd night, or so, that I had the phone, I went to a family event incredibly excited to try out the camera on this new phone and record some memories. When I arrived, I tried to open my camera and the app crashed. I tried again... crash. I uninstalled and reinstalled and the app was still crashing. Installed security updated, reinstalled camera--still crashing. So, here I am at a family event trying my hardest to fix the camera on my phone. Upon 2nd follow up with Google, I asked that my case be referred to a supervisor. The representative advised that a supervisor would be in touch within 48 hours. No one has proactively followed up with me. Now I'm here, having spent over $1200 on cell phones in 8 months, and neither phone is fully functional. I feel wronged with Google's unwillingness to right the 7-month old freezing issue at their cost, while I feel incredibly disappointed that the 2nd device came with issues right out of the box.

From there it was smooth sailing.,"So I'll pretense this with the fact that I probably would have given this phone a solid 3.5-4 star rating out of the gate, but I toughed it out and I'm glad I did. The battery was draining pretty quickly for the cost that that was really doing it in for me; no other features mattered if I couldn't get through the day to use them. But I gave the phone a chance and I'm really glad that I did. This is the best android phone I've had. Prior to this phone I was bouncing back and forth between the Samsung Galaxy S8+ and the iPhone X because I loved the iPhone's size camera but I so longed for android's OS which took heavy launcher modification on the Galaxy S8+. In comes the Pixel 4XL, which gave me the stock android I'd missed so dearly since my old Nexus 6. After charging through a couple of battery cycles, the battery is usually sitting at 50% at the end of the day, so for me, the phone usually lasts about 1.5 days solid, no questions. Battery is never a problem. Its unfortunate that this phone caught so much flack for battery drain because in my own tests, idk if they did tweaks with updates or if the battery needed to be exercised, but I never have ANY issues anymore with it after charging it up and draining it the first couple of times. Now it lasts all day. The camera is unreal. Although people will be frustrated that it doesn't have two cameras on front and 3 cameras on back (the wide angle cameras), the front camera is already has a very wide FOV, much wider than the iPhone X, which made it an instant upgrade for me, not to mention the quality was much better. The rear cameras are incredibly crisp, and exactly what I enjoy, which is true color. I'm not a fan of Samsung's camera software which tends to over saturate photos natively, so the Pixels camera is provides photos that are just how you see them which is how I like them. The night site works incredibly well which I've tested extensively inside, outside, on the move, and stationary. The video I can't speak to because I haven't tested. The face unlock is absurdly fast almost to a fault, and it does work at angles which the iPhone does not. It is, although, quite annoying that other apps don't work with it yet. I'm hoping that changes soon. I've tried my hand at a lot of different manufacturers over the years in HTC, Samsung, Google, Apple, Motorola, and LG, and so far the Pixel 4 XL has won me over as my favorite to date.",11.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked

I upgraded my wife's iPhone 6s to the 11 pro and man - if I wasn't such an avid hater of iOS and all things Apple, I would take that phone in an instant. Pixel 4 XL Cons: Battery life sucks already. I can barely make 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., so I imagine this will degrade very fast in the near and distant future. I don't take a lot of pictures, but if I do video it drains quick. Watching videos the same situation. I don't use the phone hardly at all, and text message a lot, and I'm always below 15% every night. Audio port still gone for no reason I mean seriously? The bar across the top. Really? For a sensor that Samsung failed to spread with the Galaxy 5? Really? Swipe my hands really? No wide angle lens like the iPhone 11 pro, but yet a massive box on the back. Ugly. Vibration is still really poor. How can you not have this as a setting to increase? My legs are, as a result of decades of cell phone vibration, immune to Pixel vibration. Tried the iPhone 11 pro and it's much more noticeable. Sound volume still sucks. It just doesn't play loud enough, especially speaker phone. Like seriously it's mandatory to have wireless ear buds just so I can hear anything on my phone? Or a bluetooth speaker? Incessant Google Assistant - Quit asking me to set it up I'm not giving you my voice data regardless of how many times you ask. And last but not least, my biggest gripe with Google services in general - backups. There is ZERO support for full backups of your phone. Especially your SMS and MMS. ZERO. So if you don't use a 3rd party app on a regular basis to backup your phone, you are screwed. Don't ever let anyone tell you different, if you do a factory reset without a backup all of your app data including Messages will be erased and irretrievable. Shame on a billion dollar company to not 1 let you know ahead of time, 2 false advertising that it can even do backups and 3 doesn't provide backup options. SHAME SHAME. Pixel XL 4 Pros: 128 GB of storage? The 90 hz that I can't use in any app but is supposedly there? All in all I'm more than disappointed in myself for buying this thing, especially on launch day when it's dropped $200. And I'm just disappointed in Google. They ruined my experience and there's nothing new on this phone that I didn't already have on my 2 XL. Unfortunately I still like the Google ecosystem but this will be my last Google phone.

B07YMNLXL3,Bernie Bernbaum,5,"October 30, 2019",False,Great Phone,"I'm an iPhone user and bought the Pixel 4 for it's camera. I do a travel blog and I've been dragging a Nikon D7500 camera with an 18-300mm lens with me. The Pixel will allow me to put the ""camera"" in my pocket when I'm not using it. I've been testing the camera and It's not the same as the Nikon - it's better in low light but has some weaknesses in regular light. The zoom is good and bad. It will zoom well and give me a sufficiently sharp image - but the resolution (number of pixels) is not that large. If I crop the picture there's not many pixels left. In regular light, I find the color and contrast a bit ""sharp"" which makes the picture look a bit processed. I'm working on improving that with the adjustments I can do on the camera. The Pixel does provide RAW images but they don't give me as much adjustment range as the RAW images from my Nikon. Some people complain about the lack of a wide angle camera but I can always do a panorama. The battery should have been bigger so I'll get a battery case for it to make sure I have sufficient charge. It just makes the phone a bit thicker which I don't object to. Otherwise, I find that Android provides pretty much the same features and functionality as my iPhone but does them differently so there's a learning curve for me. Not really hard but it'll take time for me to be comfortable with it. Computational photography is obviously the future of photography and I expect that Google will make improvements to the camera over time. But for my use, I think the Pixel 4 will release me from having to lug around a big camera and lens. I bought the 128GB version to make sure I have enough memory for pictures, especially since I use the RAW function. I'll dump the pictures to my computer each night. I shoot more than four thousand pictures on a normal trip so dumping them off the phone each night is necessary. Overall, I'm pleased with the phone.

B07YMNLXL3,KC,2,"December 4, 2019",False,Snapped along the antenna lines on the sides within 3 days,"I bought this phone to replace my Pixel 3 XL, because its rear camera died 5 days after the warranty ended. (sigh) Initial impressions were poor. The lack of a fingerprint reader sucks, no matter how fast the face scanning is. I could unlock my Pixel 3 with an index finger before it even left my pocket, which is now impossible. It also doesn't always wake up and scan, meaning you have to tap the screen until it scans. The radar gimmick is, well, a gimmick. The only thing it seems to be useful for is swapping between songs, but it's very VERY unreliable even for this. It doesn't consistently detect swipes, so you end up waving your hand at your phone frantically with nothing happening. It's also supposed to wake up the screen when you reach for it. Again, the success rate of this seems to be pretty low, meaning you again have to tap the screen to wake it up. Wouldn't have been a problem with a fingerprint reader. I was ready to get over these deficiencies after the first couple of days, but then the worst thing happened. There are four antenna lines that run horizontally on the sides of the phone, under black paint. They're positioned above the power button and the SIM card tray at the top, with two more at the bottom somewhere. Somehow the entire phone bent inwards and snapped at this point, leaving two cracks on either side and the screen bent slightly inwards. I realize this is likely my fault, and I probably leaned on my pocket or something at some point. But I am 100% sure I did not put an excessive amount of pressure on the phone in the first few days. I've used the Pixel 3XL in the same pockets for the past year, and the Pixel 2 before that. The thing just snapped like nothing. There's no reinforcement in the sides whatsoever. This is a $1000 phone. Why does it feel like a cheap iPhone knockoff? I can't stand iOS, and Samsung are slow on updates.

B07YMNLXL3,MikeS_CT,5,"December 4, 2019",False,A really great phone for the right user,"First off, I waited until Black Friday to buy the phone because I knew there would be a significant price drop. I will never buy a Pixel phone on day one unless I win the lottery and money becomes no object. I recommend waiting that month to anyone who isn't rich. I upgraded from a Pixel 2 XL and owned a Nexus 6P before that. I enjoy Google's version of Android quite a bit and consider the hardware trade-offs worth it. My wife has a Samsung Galaxy S10 plus and there is no question that it's a more refined phone as far as screen, battery etc, but Samsung's version of Android -- while better than it was a few years ago -- is still bloated and unappealing to me. I consider this phone a worthwhile upgrade to my Pixel 2 XL. The screen is much better, and while it could be brighter it is noticably brighter in sunlight than the 2 XL. The 90 Hz display refresh rate makes for noticably smooth scrolling and is a welcome improvement, I have enabled it all of the time in Developer Options with no big jump in battery usage. The upgrade to 6 GB of RAM is also a welcome upgrade. I know that it's still stingy by flagship standards, but I see no lag in the phone so I'm okay with it. The black phone is indeed, as others have noted, a fingerprint magnet, but my phone always goes in a case anyway. If I didn't use a case I would definitely go with white or orange though. Wireless charging is a nice upgrade from my Pixel 2 XL, and from what I hear about the Pixel 3 much faster than on that phone. The battery life is fairly meh, but I find that even on heavy use days a quick boost during the day gets me through. Since I use Android Auto on my commute and the phone charges while plugged into that that's more than enough to get me through any day. I also have a wireless charger on my desk at work if need be. If I was in a situation where I was unable to charge my phone during the day the battery life on this phone might seem like more of a negative. If you are a heavy user who demands to go all day without charging than this probably isn't the phone for you. One thing I love about this year's design is the relatively flat screen. The curved screen of my 2 XL demanded an expensive Whitestone Dome screen protector to protect it without losing screen sensitivity, as does the curved screen of my wife's Galaxy S10 plus. The flat screen of the 4 XL only needs an inexpensive tempered glass screen protector to work perfectly and protect my investment. And I like the way the phone looks. I love the camera, which is always a strong point with Pixel phones. When I shoot video I use 1080p rather than 4k, so the fact that the phone doesn't support 4k 60 for video doesn't bother me. If video at that resolution and frame rate matter to you than this isn't your phone. I love this phone for still photography, which is a personal hobby, and the addition of the telephoto lens is a big plus. Wish they added a wide angle lens, too. That would have been a big plus. I don't shoot many selfies, but I know some users are bummed about the removal of the wide angle selfie camera from the Pixel 3. If that's important to you then you might want to get a different phone. I really like the face unlock. It has worked well for me. Fast and consistent. I don't even think about it much anymore, it just works. On rare occasions that taking my phone out of a pocket doesn't trigger the face unlock then double tapping the screen wakes it up. To sum up, while I don't think this is a perfect phone, I believe that the Google software experience combined with the camera and the bumped up RAM makes it a worthwhile upgrade for those like me who really like Pixel phones. I don't think they're for everybody, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this phone. One thing I would definitely recommend now that the phone has returned to post Black Friday full pricing is to wait for the next sale. As stated above, this phone isn't for everyone. No phone is. However, if you pay attention to the strengths and weaknesses and assess your own needs correctly it really is a great phone for the right user. I'm happy to stay in the Google Pixel experience for the next 2 years. When I'm ready to upgrade I'll look at what will probably be the Pixel 6 XL and decide if that phone has earned the next 2 years of my phone usage. Even if it does, I will certainly wait until the phone goes on sale to buy it.",,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked
B07YMNLXL3,Alex Kalinovsky,2,"December 23, 2019",False,Promising but ultimately disappointing,"I enjoy google products and for the longest time wanted to try a pure Android phone. Bought Pixel4 and really tried to like it. Setup was simple, transferred data from my Galaxy S7 and started setting up security. That's where I realized there is no fingerprint reader. Not the end of the world but it's convenient, reliable and many apps use it as a primary authentication. OK, Google suggests FaceId so I set it up. It worked well at first, even though I can't call it ""secure"" because anyone can take your phone, point it at your face even when you are sleeping, and it gets unlocked. Still, I thought I'd get used to it. Within 2 days face unlock simply stopped working. I tried re-setup it, no luck. Says ""unable to recognize"". I had to go back to using a pattern which is not secure at all. Typing a pin code is a pain in the butt. Within a day the pattern recognition stopped working, not sure why. Tried searching for answers, the resolution is factory reset which you can't even do through normal settings... that didn't fix it either, so phone became useless. I ended up just returning it and getting a Galaxy S10. Not what I was hoping for but ultimately proved to be a better product.

B07YMNLXL3,Matt B,4,"November 28, 2019",False,Not great not terrible,"It's not the greatest of the Android flagships, but it's a good phone. I preordered the Pixel 4 XL and recently got my $100 Google Store credit, only for it to drop $200 for Black Friday, lol. I could have waited a bit longer but my Nexus 6P went into an infinite boot loop a couple months ago after nearly 4 years, so I waited and got the Pixel 4 XL. As others have said, it doesn't have the brightest screen, but I find it sufficient. The 90 Hz refresh isn't on all of the time by default unless you enable it in the developer options, which I did. I noticed that some reviewers (in general) were disappointed with the battery life, but it lasts me the whole day with my level of usage. I bought a pair of Seneo wireless chargers, 6' USB-C cables, and adapters--one for the home and another for the office, also bought the iOttie wireless charger for the car. Needless to say, I'm rarely below 80% battery. So far, the radar sensor is just a gimmick for actually directing the phone to perform actions since it's a bit sluggish even for skipping through songs or YouTube clips. But I do appreciate the fact that it lowers the volume of my alarm when my hand reaches over it when I go to snooze it! The camera quality is fantastic for photos, and it's decent for video, the stabilization is great. The face unlock is very fast, and yes, it can unlock with your eyes closed, and who knows when that'll be fixed. I have a twin brother, and his face is similar enough to mine (not identical) that even he could unlock my phone... Which brings me to my next point: I really dislike the fact that there is no fingerprint reader. It's annoying that most apps don't acknowledge facial recognition for app logins yet, so I have to resort to typing in the pin or password. All in all, if you love stock Android and are due for an upgrade like I was, then this is a very good phone!

I say *normal usage* cause at the extremes (low light + filmy potraits + wide angles) iPhone 11pro is better. So, overally - Pixel 4 has the best camera. - Display with 90Hz is the best display out there. Period. - Software experience is amazing. Very clean and smooth. - Very fast and responsive. - Has some new features along with face unlock - it's not perfect by any means but it has potential.

It goes up and down depending on usage. - Camera cutout at the back is disgusting.

B07YMNLXL3,Shanks,2,"October 22, 2019",True,Flagship price without the flagship performance/features,"This review is of the white 64GB Pixel 4 (non XL) that I received from Amazon on 10/21/19. I have used it for exactly 48hrs so far and here is my early impressions – Good stuff – 1. The build quality is impressive. The matte back is fingerprint resistant and the phone is a beauty! 2. The dual (Stereo) speakers are loud and have good clarity. 3. Fast charger is included with the phone. Bad stuff – Unfortunately this is a longer list. 1. Battery life is miserable. The phone has a 2800mAh battery that lasted me 18hrs with <30 minutes of screen on time. These 18hrs also included an 8hr of sleep time at night, so users will need to charge this at least twice daily, even with minimal usage. 2. The 90Hz screen is mostly limited to 60Hz. You’ll have to enable “Force 90Hz” option in “Developer settings” if you want to use it in its full glory. 3. The face unlock struggles in dark. It also sometimes does not work until you press the power button to activate the phone (I have radar on, so the phone does know my presence). In absence of other biometric options, a crappy face unlock isn’t ideal. One out of 3 times I had to enter my PIN, as the Face Unlock did not work. Most importantly, it works even with eyes closed, so it means someone can unlock your phone while you are sleeping by just pointing it at your face. 4. There isn't a USB-C earphone included with the phone. 5. There isn't a USB-C to 3.5mm dongle included with the phone to use with headphones. 6. Free unlimited storage on Google Photos is being discontinued with the Pixel 4 and Google wants you to pay for cloud storage. 7. Base model is only 64GB, which is tiny for a phone in 2019. 128GB should have been the base model or at least a memory card slot should have been included. 8. No dual front facing camera like the Pixel 3. 9. No wide angle rear camera – This is a big deal for a 2019 flagship phone. Those who watched the Pixel 4 launch keynote, you know how stupid they sounded when they tried to justify the inclusion of telephote over wide angle. 10. No 60fps or higher video recording at 4K. Google cited that the limited internal storage is the reason they have not enabled higher fps at 4K, even though the hardware is capable. I am speechless…can’t they just give the users an option? 11. Too expensive at $799 for a flagship phone in 2019 with the above flaws. I am going back to my OnePlus phone, which isn’t flawless by any means, but is a very good phone for what it offers and the price it comes at. I can't recommend the Pixel 4 to anyone and don't know if the audience that Google is trying to sell this to, actually exists. If you really want a Pixel, get the 3a...it is a great phone at a very good price!",16.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked
B07YMNLXL3,Adrian,1,"October 26, 2019",True,What happens when you have a software company designing hardware? Huge ill-informed disappointments.,"I used to wish I had a Pixel 3/3XL instead of my S8+, but I always told myself I would wait for the Pixel 4 to release before blowing a load of cash on a shiny new google device. I used my Pixel 4 for a day before returning it. Pros: 1. Fantastic software - The entire interface, assistant, and just general ""all built in"" feel of using the phone is fantastic. However, Google is at it's core a software company, so this would make sense. It's THEIR ecosystem. We can only expect this. 2. Solid build quality. Feels like a great phone. Responsive and clear display. 3. The camera. I'm gonna miss this. It's pretty great and the magic google works on your photos often works out to make them look instagram/facebook/twitter ready without any tweaking. Cons: 1. The battery life. I can not even begin to state what a huge, massive, gaping CON this is. The night I got it I used it a bit, got the battery down, and gave it a full charge in the morning and started the day with a full battery at about 10 AM. By 6:30 PM with minimal use over the course of the day here and there, 30 minutes of bluetooth music streaming in my car, some browsing etc., it got down to 9%. NOW, like I said, it was at 9% at 6:30 PM. What happened next was amazing. I hopped on the phone and opened Chrome, and while just browsing the web watched the battery drop percent by percent from 9% to dead over the course of SEVEN MINUTES. It just kept ticking down right in front of my eyes. Almost 10% battery life gone over seven minutes of web browsing. This totally blew me away. In case you haven't caught on to everyone's point of judgment yet, the pixel 4 actually has less battery capacity than the Pixel 3. This was huge mistake on Google's part. This device consumes more battery life from a lower total supply. Unforgivable. 2. The whole telephoto thing... Google did a regular lens and a telephoto lens. No ultra-wide. They gave some reason why but it was a bad reason based on how ""they feel."" 3. The price. This is a flagship and is priced like a flagship, but is falling short of cheaper alternatives like the Oneplus 7T. I'm really bummed that this phone didn't work out for me. I just absolutely can not tolerate my phone dying after ~3.5 hours of use. I can't even imagine if I had tried playing Pokemon Go on it or something battery intensive. What if I were in another country and were relying on this thing? It just really doesn't work. I would have dealt with everything/almost anything else if not for the battery life issue. I hope that google really feels some serious scathing pain over this device pushing them to do a better job next year, because I REALLY wanted a good Pixel, but I won't be shocked if by then Amazon has released a phone that outperforms it in every way attached to their own ecosystem, like they have done with countless other products. This could have all been easily figured out and resolved of course, had the company made the specs of their phone public far earlier. The cries of ""what are they thinking?"" could have possibly allowed them to quickly pivot and resolve these issues, but instead they waited until a week before release to show off their paperweight. This has to some degree turned into rambling. I'm annoyed, I'm disappointed, I expected better. Just don't buy this phone. UPDATE: Due to a newer review stating that I ""must have had my phone on max brightness streaming 4K video"" I'm making this update to clarify my usage even further. I had the phone on adaptive brightness as most people would, and at no point did I stream video. It also looks like fake reviews are starting to pop up.

B07YMNLXL3,Siamak M.,5,"November 6, 2019",True,Dual Sim Dual Standby and Dual Network problem solved...,"I had been looking for this technology for a few years, because my corporate phone is on Verizon (CDMA) and my personal phone is GS/LTE , which meant that I had to carry two phones because of this issue. Pixel 4 DSDS and dual network capability (only phone on the market with this capability as of now), solved my problem in that I can now carry a single phone with 2 numbers in both CDMA (Verizon) and GSM/LTE coverage area. Good job google. I am willing to bet that Verizon hardware sales won't like this phone. There is however a downside with any phone that uses an eSim (yes one of the two sims on Pixel 4 is an eSim while the other is a physical sim), is that if your phone gets damaged, you will not have a physical sim to use in your spare phone and you must then get a physical sim activated by your provider...which means when your damaged eSim phone has been repaired, you will then have to download the eSim back onto your eSim phone (which I think will mean yet another visit to your provider) This is of course not a problem if you don't have a habit of breaking your phones, like I do.",13.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked
B07YMNLXL3,AnarchyJim,3,"October 25, 2019",True,First thing to do: Manually update all the apps,"So considering switching from the iPhone and testing this out. We are not off to a good start. First off, I was excited by the possibilities of the new Recorder app and built-in transcription. Turns out, this is not installed by default when you get the phone. It's the old Recorder (version 0.5). To get the new Recorder, along with many of the other features that Google touts the Pixel 4 having, you have to go manually update all the apps (Open the Play Store, Select Your Apps, then Select Updates). THEN it installs Recorder 1.0 which has the transcription stuff. However, this is not obvious. Why would Google ship with Recorder 0.5 and other non-release version apps? Frustrating when you're trying to check out all the 'cool' new features touted at the launch. Apple would never do something like this. At least automatically update all the apps when it does the initial 'Check for System Updates'. Secondly, Google's support is useless. They don't know anything and that's assuming you can figure out how to contact them. The camera is great, but nothing special compared to other phones at this point. The HDR trick they use to deal with low light photos leaves something to be desired. I'm not crazy about the look. With the Just Black phone, both front and back are glass which makes it somewhat slippery. You'll probably need a case with it. It's frosted along the sides which is great, but it'd be better if there was more surface area on the back that was frosted. So, a little disappointed with how frustrating it's been out of the box. Now that everything has been updated, we'll see if the user experience improves. Right now, I'll probably return this and stick with the iPhone.",7.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked

Battery life is more than acceptable, not a top feature. Video stabilization is good, but looks artificial at times. It's different from the iPhone or a GoPro with HyperSmooth. Soli is neat but I don't use it for gestures, just proximity stuff and to speed up face unlock. Screen resolution is a good balance of resolution and performance on the XL.

From full charge in the morning, to browsing the internet, listening to music via bluetooth headphones, checking email, etc etc periodically through the day, I usually end up with about 40-50% battery left easily. To say its done within a couple of hours, that person must have max screen brightness and streaming 4k videos. The screen is incredible, and camera flawless. I am however taking off a star due to not caring for the round edges on the screen and am still having a hard time adjusting to face unlock over fingerprint. Everything else about the phone is nothing short of extremely well executed. One more point, how on earth is face unlock any less secure than a fingerprint scanner? Both can only be opened by the person using the phone. And someone could just as easily put your finger on a scanner as moving it over your face if you're incapacitated. So confused by that one, but that guy got on here to troll as he doesnt even have a verified purchase. Not sure what his agenda is.",5.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked

Critics knocked this phone, but I gotta tell ya. It's fantastic. Pros: * The Vanilla Android Experience. It's fantastic. Much better than Samsungs or LGs UI. * Camera - I don't care what DXO Mark says. This and the Iphone 11 have the best cameras. I was using the Note 10+ before this and it doesn't even come close. If you have kids that move around. This is the camera to get. Hands down. * Face Unlock - Never thought I'd appreciate it so much. Fast, accurate. Fantastic * Screen - Fantastic. Smooth. I turned the 90Hz off and didn't notice a difference. It's great. * Sound Quality - As good as the best out there. Cons - * Battery life is Good. Not terrible. But at these prices you expect Google to keep up with phones like the Note 10 * They took away the finger print scanner, which is fine, but with that they also took away the ""Menu Down"" feature you could use w/ the finger print scanner. That....I miss. * I would have wanted a bigger screen for this price, bu that's me being picky. * Price - Only buy this phone on sale. Not woth $900 or 1K . I bought it on Black Friday. I went from the Pixel 2XL to the Note 10+. I wasn't happy with the Note 10+. Battery life was fantastic but the pictures were just terrible. I gotta tell you....this is the phone.

Plus, with wireless charging, is it really so hard to top off the battery during the day? The only time I have every been surprised with battery drain was when I was in a region with poor cell service, but that's not the phone's fault. Face unlock is super fast. I really don't miss fingerprint unlock, assuming Chase gets it together and adds face unlock support. People are crying that face unlock works while you are sleeping and that is ""sooooo insecure""... um do your fingerprints disappear while you sleep or close your eyes?

B07YMNLXL3,Randomness,4,"December 2, 2019",True,Good phone if you manage to get it on sale,"So I decided to buy Pixel 4 since I was being really disappointed with the direction that Samsung was going towards in terms of hardware and software. Here are my impressions after some time with it when comparing it with my Galaxy S9+ : Hardware features: I don't really care for headphone jack but it is inexcusable that Google removed fingerprint sensor. Using it is much more convenient than face unlock and fingerprint sensor is much more reliable in all light conditions. I really miss it when going from S9+ to Pixel 4. Bring it back, Google. Display: the display quality on my Galaxy S9+ is better - it is more uniform and feels like it is more color accurate. Especially when looking at it at an angle or turning the phone. On the other hand I really dislike curves on the sides of Galaxy display and I like that Google went with flat display. I also dislike that Samsung is putting random notches and holes into their display on their latest models and I like how Google has finally abandoned this trend and hopefully future Pixel devices also won't have any notches or holes. Battery life: the battery life on Pixel 4 XL is better compared to Galaxy S9+. Not really surprising since Samsung puts a lot of their own services running in background. However, having more battery capacity would be even better since Pixel 4 XL lasts less on single charge than any iPhone 11 model or some Android phones with higher battery capacity. Software: Google's software experience is great and I like it much more than Samsung and its awful One UI. No huge wasted space, no excessively rounded corners, working spam call protection, better messenger, no bloatware, no redundant apps. The only issue with Google software is they put the search bar on home screen which I do not want to use and you cannot remove it unless you will use different launcher. Sound quality: the sound quality on Samsung Galaxy S9+ is better. It is more neutral, with less bass emphasis. Photo quality: it is better on Pixel 4 in all modes. Video quality: Galaxy S9+ takes better video quality and it can record 4k 60fps videos, Pixel 4 cannot do that. All in all Pixel 4 XL is a good phone for the current sale price but it should have been much better considering it is a flagship device and considering that whole idea of Android and their devices is to give users more choice. Hopefully Google will bring fingerprint sensor back in future devices, give more video taking options and give larger battery capacity (even cheapest iPhone 11 is beating Pixel 4 XL in terms of battery use).",,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked
B07YMNLXL3,jophus,5,"December 1, 2019",True,Pleasantly surprised.,"I purchased this Pixel 4 during the Black Friday sale. At $599, it is a great value. I can't say I'd feel the same way at full price of $799. Don't get me wrong. It's a great device. The two main complaints I've read about are a lack of a wide focus camera and battery size. I've never owned a phone with a wide angle lens, but there have been a few times where I wish I had one, but the camera on this phone rocks, and I can't fault it for not having a feature I've never had on past phones. Yes, the battery is smaller than industry standard for modern smart phones. But what's amazing is that with a small battery, a processor that's one version behind the most current, and a 90 hz screen, the small battery lasts longer than expected and I haven't been disappointed about battery life. And when it does need to be replenished, it charges FAST. I was hesitant making the purchase because of the critical reviews, but I've been pleasantly surprised that the most talked about issues aren't really issues at all.",,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked

B07YMNLXL3,LindsayP,4,"December 12, 2019",True,Unspectacular but solid,"When the new Pixel 4 was released I took a look at my two-year-old Pixel 2 and wondered if I really needed to upgrade, given what a great phone it had been, and still is. Giving in to a bit of retail therapy is easy, so I did. It's an expensive business getting a Pixel phone in this country (New Zealand) since it's a buy from Amazon in the US, shipping to the other end of the world, paying GST (our sales tax) converted to NZ dollars added up to $1,550. Was it worth it? Let's take a look. I've owned a lot of android phones and had the Pixel 4 for a few months now and it's performed pretty much flawlessly, both the software and the hardware - as I expected it would. I really like Google's own implementation of their Android O/S - it's clean and just works. There are some UI annoyances that I'll come to later. Other makes (Huawei, Samsung) all seem to be clogged up with unnecessary and buggy extra apps and take years to get Android updates through. I get Google's updates within days of release and I've never had a bad one. In their attempt to regain a handful of pixels from the bottom of the screen, Google have removed the Home and Back on-screen buttons and replaced them with gestures. This has or will probably occur on other makes of phone as Android 10 rolls out. The new gesture needs a swipe from the bottom edge (home) or from either side (back), and I pretty much hate it. If you miss the edge (it's tricky if you have a case with a raised edge) then you end up swiping the app off to somewhere unwanted. If you get a bit close to the edge when you're scrolling within an app, you suddenly go home or back. It doesn't happen to me very often but when it does happen it's infuriating. Hint: When buying a case, look for one with a low profile on the screen side - though that won't protect the screen quite as well. As for other features, I'm not so sure there's a lot to say. The main one is the face recognition lock which I've turned on and also the ""Keep phone unlocked while I'm looking at it"" option. I like that one, it saves the phone going black when I'm taking my time reading, or something. It's also nice to just pick up the phone and look at it, it's so natural, quick and easy. People seem unduly worried about the security of this feature, I'm not sure why except maybe for the unlock while you're asleep. If someone is in a position to do that, then they are also in a position to do many awful things to me and additionally, the banking and other vulnerable stuff on my phone has a further level of security. The screen is up to par, and the glass is nice not picking up oily finger goop like all my others did after a while. I've given up on screen protectors, my phones are pretty safe being mostly in my pocket, and I like the feel of the screen. Feels like a solid build to me without being too heavy, though it's heavier than the Pixel 2 and has quite a bit more screen, mostly in the length. People seem to rave about the camera and I agree it's good, but so was the Pixel 2 so the step up doesn't seem huge to me - but then I'm no camera buff. The Pixel 2 was a bit better at close-ups which I do a lot of when working with electronics. The Pixel 4 can be zoomed up to 8x but can't focus closer than about 120mm which limits its use as a macro camera. The P2 was good down to about 60mm. (4.7"" and 2.4"") Sound is surprisingly good watching a video. There's nothing at the bass end but that's to be expected in such a small body. The volume is good and the sound spread is wide though perhaps a bit overdone. I'm not in a cathedral. I regularly use speakerphone and also Sennheiser Bluetooth headphones, and they perform very well on both phone calls and music. Bluetooth, WiFi, and 4G connectivity all seem solid. Battery life is marginal, my only real complaint about the hardware. An overnight charge to 100% would all be gone by 7pm if I wasn't quite careful. To counter this I bought a charger for the car so I can give it a commute-time top-up and things are better now. Wireless charging is cool and Qi chargers all seem to work fine. Makes charging in the car a breeze with a charger built into the holder. Wireless charging is not fast, about 0.9 amps, compared to a fast charger which charges at nearly 3 amps (~1 hr full charge time) but it turns the phone into a hotplate and could affect battery life. I recently bought a Samsung Galaxy Active 2 Smartwatch (SM-R810) and paired it up easily with the Pixel via Bluetooth, but with a fair amount of convoluted messing about with the Samsung apps got it all working reasonably well though it's a bit crazy and somewhat buggy. I sure wish Samsung would produce practical software like Google does. I did a review on the watch too. So was it worth it? Probably not, but mostly because my old Pixel 2 was such a nice reliable workhorse that has never slowed down even with 150 or so apps. Every other phone I ever owned has slowly ground to a standstill. I use quite a lot of apps. Am I glad I bought it? For sure, but I just can't part with the Pixel 2 so now that one's a spare.",,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked

Applications open super fast compared to my Nexus 5x No bloatware included. Bad No fingerprint reader but face recognition will make you forget about it. The battery life is not that great but way better than my Nexus 5x I had issues syncing my contacts and activating phone login prompt for 2nd authentication but turning off wifi and using carrier data solved the issue.

If you have anything on your face (obviously) then it won't work. I get it, but it's unfortunate that you can't use it if you're wearing winter gear (or a CPAP or . . . the list goes on).

B07YMNLXL3,Tristan,3,"December 9, 2019",False,Hard pass,"I REALLY wanted to like this phone. I do not. I wish I had not purchased it. Cons: -Soli chip and radar are gimmicky at best. It does work for things like user-proximity detection and alarm/call atting/silencing. -Face unlock is capricious and only works about 45% of the time. Unacceptable given that face unlock is the only biometric security available on this phone. -I've had significant issues with connectivity; LTE randomly downgrades to 3g (or no connection); I frequently miss calls and texts until I hook into wifi; I get service droughts where others clearly get good service; network switching does not seem to work. -I have spent more time with Customer Service to address issues with this phone than with any other phone that I have used. -The screen scratches extraordinarily easily -No SD card slot (and, no, 128 gigs is not enough space for all my stuff and, no, cloud storage is not the same) Pros: -At least Android 10 is decent. -Same size as my last phone (Galaxy S9+) -90hz screen does make scrolling and gaming slightly nicer -Adaptive color and brightness mostly works -128gig of storage",1.0,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked
B07YMNLXL3,Knightman,5,"December 24, 2019",False,"Everyone has an opinion, but some people are free thinkers","My wife’s phone started acting up so I gave her my 3 month old LG G8, and went about purchasing a replacement. I bought the pixel 4 initially and really liked it but the battery life left a lot to desire. I went with the XL and will share my thoughts. Design: No matter what color you get I like the look in the back and the square camera bump all looks nice. The contrasting power button and google logo looks nice. Interestingly enough the large awkward forehead on the 4, looks less so on the xl size might have something to with the 4 compact and narrow size vs the xl. While some people think phone looks dated or utilitarian, I find it attractive and kind of iconic. The pixel 4 is one of the few phones you can look at the front of it and identify what phone it is. Screen: The xl uses a samsung panel vs the lg panel the smaller sibling uses. You would think the higher ppi on the xl would make a significant difference, but I was not able to find it. It might just be that I prefer the lg panel as the QHD on the G8 was noticeable vs the full hd+ of the pixel 4. The 90 hz refresh is nice I would not call it a can’t live without it feature though. It does make scrolling more smooth, but I am not a gamer so that is really the only benefit for me. Feel: The xl is the biggest phone I have ever owned. It is amazing when you put it against the g8 it only seems slightly taller but then in the hand they feel different. I find the lg g8 is the perfect size phone with good one handed use and enough screen real estate to make searching comfortable. On the regular 4 it was too narrow and did not have enough room in landscape mode for the keyboard to enter data when browsing. The xl is large but is not so bad to operate one-handed. The xl size allows for better media consumption as well. Fack unlock: there is no fingerprint sensor and some people will bemoan the loss of it but the face unlock works reliably and quickly. The whole it unlocks with your eyes closed complaint which is corny to me and I will echo what others have said in that if you are worried about someone taking your phone while you are asleep and unlocking it, then you probably have bigger problems than a phone purchase. Camera: I am not a professional and I just want something that is easy to operate and that takes photos that look good. The pixel does this and the camera snobs say it is one of if not thee best. Performance and Sound: has a flagship processor so it is fast, not much more to say without splitting hairs that it does not have the 855+. It sounds good as well with stereo separation. I don’t like the lack of headphone jack but this is the current trend. Battery life: I got rid of the regular pixel 4 mostly because of its battery life with light use seemed to go down quickly. I can’t remember the last time I had battery anxiety and with the pixel 4 unfortunately I did. Not so with the xl, which for me last a day and a half. With a smartphone, I should be able to be away from a charger for a full day and feel like my phone won’t die on me. I think reviewers are lumping pixel 4 battery life with the xl model they are nothing alike. Value: I find flagships too pricey overall and I will always wait for sales which can come quickly for plenty of devices. I paid $499 for the g8 less than 6 months after release, and paid $599 for the regular 4 a month after release and then paid $749 for the xl. $600 is my threshold but I was able to rationalize it because it came with a google nest home hub free, which I will re-gift to someone. The issue I have though is with the price is the small base storage and lack of accessories in the box.. It does not include headphones, or even adapter since there is no headphone jack. Plenty of phones come with a screen protector applied, and a case in the box. Disappointing. Competition: there are plenty of good to great phones out there, and deciding on one is of course personal preference. I didn’t choose any of the oneplus phones because they don’t offer wireless charging which I like. Samsung is out for me as well because seem to be doing their own thing with one UI. ZTE has a nice phone at a good price that I did consider but I they have a slow upgrade path. I went with the pixel line because of its compatibility with all things android, has all the main features I value in a smart phone and as far as I know is the only brand that the native voicemail allows transcription on my carrier without an extra purchase. The lg line is right up there as well, but they lack the quick updates, and native voicemail does not work on my carrier. Last generation pixels do offer better value minus some features like no 90 hz and slow wireless charging. Final thoughts: When you compare the pixel 4 vs the G8 I was depressed because the pixel 4 just does not measure up and it felt like a step back. WIth the XL model I don’t feel that way, which is odd because the xl adds a larger battery, higher resolution. I think this mostly goes to that the pixel 4 is probably too small for me and while the xl is on the big size I can easily move throughout the web and not feel cramped when doing it. I feel that the xl measures up to the G8 even with the price difference. The xl does not have as many ways to do the same thing as the g8 (unlocking your phone, listening to music) but it has 90 hz screen, better camera, better ui, original design and for me native voicemail with transcription. I do like the G8 size better but using the xl does not make me jealous that my wife now has the G8.",,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked
B07YMNLXL3,CannonBaller,2,"December 6, 2019",False,Disappointing phone from Google - Google Fan,"I have been waiting for the Pixel 4 for about 2 years now, as more information leaked it seemed to be a promising device and I was quite excited to be upgrading from my Pixel 2 XL to the Pixel 4 XL. About 3 months before the launch of the Pixel 4 I dropped my Pixel 2 XL and the screen shattered, well now I have to update. I watched the keynote and was VERY disappointed in this device, they made excuses for not having the wide-angle lens, 5g support, and bad battery. I decided to still roll the dice on this device and thought “hey I trust google to put out something that competes with the top of the phones currently out”, boy was I wrong. Pros + Face detection when it works is fast + Smooth interface + Project Soli is kind of cool + Camera Cons - Bad battery life - won't last a day with normal use! - Face detection works about 40-60% of the time - No fingerprint sensor - You cannot use the new Google Assistant with having the old navigation. - Project Soli does not have many applications - Non-5g phone - No wide-angle lens Conclusion - If you want a phone that is mediocre compared to the other current flagship phones and a battery that won’t last the entire day get the Pixel 4 XL. Do yourself a favor and get a 3a until Google decides to do a better job.",,Google,Google Pixel 4 - Just Black - 64GB - Unlocked
